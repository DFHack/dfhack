I have an infected dwarf (she's locked away and transforms every month, so she's definitely infected); when transformed she is reported by cursecheck, but not when untransformed.\n\nI am using the download \"dfhack-0.43.03-r1-Linux-gcc-4.5.3\" with more-or-less-vanilla DF version 0.43.03 (the only modifications to raws are one custom building, changing the age at which dwarves become adults, and population/frequency/trainability of some wild creatures). I'd attach the save, but I keep getting errors.","files":null}]}
