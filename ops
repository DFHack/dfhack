The \"size\" of an sizeable item is determined by the `adultsize` property of the raw for the race of the items maker race, as returned by `getMakerRace()`. Thus, if `item` is the item in question, `world-\u003eraws.creatures.all[item-\u003egetMakerRace()]-\u003eadultsize` will return the size, in cubic centimeters divided by ten. No, I'm not kidding: sizes in DF are expressed in cubic centimeters. See the [DF wiki](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Creature_token#BODY_SIZE) for more information. A \"standard\" adult dwarf is size 60,000. For some reason, however, the size stored in the raws is one tenth the size specified in the raws, so a standard dwarf will have an in-game size of 6000.","files":null}]}
