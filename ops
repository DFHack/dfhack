Minus values are common. But `-1000000001` might be a bug.\nAlso `birth_year` and `birth_second` are always the same. As seen by the code:\n\nhttps://github.com/DFHack/scripts/blob/3987d031469420d64aff23097d9548676f1ab752/exportlegends.lua#L334-L335\n\nCan fix the `birth_second` thing later (when I have time). For the `-1000000001` is this some placeholder for \"unknown\"? I don't know how to fix that one.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1593561221,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MjEwNjk0OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1599#issuecomment-652106949"},"message":"The script might not have change, but the identity structure has definitely changed recently - mostly fixes, but it's possible that these fields got misaligned.","files":null},{"type":6,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1593561221,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDE1OlVzZXJDb250ZW50RWRpdElzc3VlQ29tbWVudEVkaXQ6MzgyNzI2Njky"},"target":"23272e24420492eef8b7027484af7e1f89d56d0a1e40e7041a75904b8dda8ae1","message":"The script might not have change, but the identity structure has definitely changed recently - mostly fixes, but it's possible that these fields got misaligned.\n(I also updated your post to use permalinks - pressing `y` on those pages is a shortcut to do that)","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1593561179,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1MDAwNzYzODE="},"added":["bug"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1593561179,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1MDAwNzYzODQ="},"added":["structures"],"removed":[]}]}
