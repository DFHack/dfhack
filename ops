I found if I quickly placed tables/chairs/doors/cabinets/chests, etc quickly in succession the game would crash. I ended up quicksaving often and placing them quite slowly. Recently tried disabling DFhack and placed items as fast as I possibly could and had zero crashes. Someone on reddit suggested that it could be a known problem with things interacting with growing trees but these were items all being placed in dwarven rooms inside the mountain.","files":null}]}
