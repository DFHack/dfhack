But that didn't work, as apparently the game spawns demons when a certain tile in the adamantine tube is revealed, and not if HFS is revealed.\n\nBasically, using tubefill and mining all the admantine WILL STILL cause demons to spawn when the part of the adamantine which was initially empty is mined.\n\nAlso, because HFS is not revealed, the game does not announce \"You have discovered an eerie cavern.\", but will only announce \"Horrifying screams come from the darkness below!\".\n\nI think this requires a fix, because otherwise the whole point of tubefill is nullified.","files":null}]}
