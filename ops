Most people will not use most scripts. This makes the output of the \"ls\" internal command cluttered and confusing. We could put lots of scripts into well-organized folders but that would require excessive typing for the scripts people do use.\n\nOne possible solution is allowing people to \"alias\" scripts in subfolders as if they were in the main folder.\n\n```\nalias gui/hack-wish hack-wish\nalias repeat -time 1 months -command repeatMonthly\n```\n\nIf this command is set up properly, it will be possible for us to arrange scripts into subfolders and have people use dfhack.init to alias the ones they use into the main folder.\n\nI'm not sure how good an idea this is.
