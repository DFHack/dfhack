I added this in to my local copy and it was able to get past the compilation error. I'm not very experienced with c/c++ so I'm not sure if this function was supposed to be declared in one of the other headers, but it seems to be from the `\u003cmath.h\u003e` header.\n\nCheers,\nBrian","files":null}]}
