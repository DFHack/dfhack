The text below is included in docs/dev/Documentation.rst - see that file for more details on the changelog setup.
This is kept in this file as a quick syntax reference.

===help

changelog.txt uses a syntax similar to RST, with a few special sequences:

- ``===`` indicates the start of a comment
- ``#`` indicates the start of a release name (do not include "DFHack")
- ``##`` indicates the start of a section name (this must be listed in ``gen_changelog.py``)
- ``-`` indicates the start of a changelog entry. **Note:** an entry currently must be only one line.
- ``:`` (colon followed by space) separates the name of a feature from a description of a change to that feature.
    Changes made to the same feature are grouped if they end up in the same section.
- ``:\`` (colon, backslash, space) avoids the above behavior
- ``- @`` (the space is optional) indicates the start of an entry that should only be displayed in NEWS-dev.rst.
    Use this sparingly, e.g. for immediate fixes to one development build in another development build that
    are not of interest to users of stable builds only.
- Three ``[`` characters indicate the start of a block (possibly a comment) that
  spans multiple lines. Three ``]`` characters indicate the end of such a block.
- ``!`` immediately before a phrase set up to be replaced (see gen_changelog.py) stops that occurrence from being replaced.

================================================================================

# Future

## New Plugins
- `autoslab`: Automatically create work orders to engrave slabs for ghostly dwarves.

## Fixes
- Fix issues with clicks "passing through" some DFHack window elements, like scrollbars

## Misc Improvements
- A new cross-compile build script was added for building the Windows files from a Linux Docker builder (see the Compile instructions in the docs)
- `hotkeys`: clicking on the DFHack logo no longer closes the popup menu
- `gui/launcher`: sped up initialization time for faster load of the UI
- `orders`: orders plugin functionality is now offered via an overlay widget when the manager orders screen is open
- `gui/quickcmd`: now has it's own global keybinding for your convenience: Ctrl-Shift-A
- Many DFHack windows can now be unfocused by clicking somewhere not over the tool window. This has the same effect as pinning previously did, but without the extra clicking.
- `overlay`: overlay widgets can now specify a default enabled state if they are not already set in the player's overlay config file

## Documentation

## API

## Lua
- `helpdb`: new function: ``helpdb.refresh()`` to force a refresh of the database. Call if you are a developer adding new scripts, loading new plugins, or changing help text during play
- `helpdb`: changed from auto-refreshing every 60 seconds to only refreshing on explicit call to ``helpdb.refresh()``. docs very rarely change during a play session, and the automatic database refreshes were slowing down the startup of `gui/launcher`
- ``widgets.Label``: ``label.scroll()`` now understands ``home`` and ``end`` keywords for scrolling to the top or bottom

## Removed

# 50.05-alpha2

## Fixes
- `autofarm`: don't duplicate status line entries for crops with no current supply
- `orders`: allow the orders library to be listed and imported properly (if you previously copied the orders library into your ``dfhack-config/orders`` directory to work around this bug, you can remove those files now)
- `tailor`: now respects the setting of the "used dyed clothing" standing order toggle

# 50.05-alpha1

## Fixes
- ``widgets.WrappedLabel``: no longer resets scroll position when window is moved or resized

## Misc Improvements
- Scrollable widgets now react to mouse wheel events when the mouse is over the widget
- the ``dfhack-config/scripts/`` folder is now searched for scripts by default
- `hotkeys`: overlay hotspot widget now shows the DFHack logo in graphics mode and "DFHack" in text mode
- `script-paths`: removed "raw" directories from default script paths. now the default locations to search for scripts are ``dfhack-config/scripts``, ``save/*/scripts``, and ``hack/scripts``
- ``init.d``: directories have moved from the ``raw`` subfolder (which no longer exists) to the root of the main DF folder or a savegame folder

## Documentation
- `overlay-dev-guide`: added troubleshooting tips and common development workflows
- added DFHack architecture diagrams to the dev intro
- added DFHack Quickstart guide

## API
- ``Gui::getDwarfmodeDims``: now only returns map viewport dimensions; menu dimensions are obsolete

## Lua
- Removed ``os.execute()`` and ``io.popen()`` built-in functions
- ``gui.View``: ``visible`` and ``active`` can now be functions that return a boolean
- ``widgets.Panel``: new attributes to control window dragging and resizing with mouse or keyboard
- ``widgets.Window``: Panel subclass with attributes preset for top-level windows
- ``widgets.CycleHotkeyLabel``: now supports rendering option labels in the color of your choice
- ``widgets.CycleHotkeyLabel``: new functions ``setOption()`` and ``getOptionPen()``
- ``widgets.ToggleHotkeyLabel``: now renders the ``On`` option in green text
- ``widgets.Label``: tiles can now have an associated width
- `overlay`: ``OverlayWidget`` now inherits from ``Panel`` instead of ``Widget`` to get all the frame and mouse integration goodies
- ``dfhack.gui.getDFViewscreen()``: returns the topmost underlying DF viewscreen
- ``gui.ZScreen``: Screen subclass that implements window raising, multi-viewscreen input handling, and viewscreen event pass-through so the underlying map can be interacted with and dragged around while DFHack screens are visible
- ``gui.View``: new function ``view:getMouseFramePos()`` for detecting whether the mouse is within (or over) the exterior frame of a view
- ``gui.CLEAR_PEN``: now clears the background and foreground and writes to the background (before it would always write to the foreground)
- ``gui.KEEP_LOWER_PEN``: a general use pen that writes associated tiles to the foreground while keeping the existing background

## Removed
- ``fix-job-postings`` from the `workflow` plugin is now obsolete since affected savegames can no longer be loaded
- Ruby is no longer a supported DFHack scripting language

# 0.47.05-r8

## New Plugins
- `overlay`: plugin is transformed from a single line of text that runs `gui/launcher` on click to a fully-featured overlay injection framework. It now houses a popup menu for keybindings relevant to the current DF screen, all the widgets previously provided by `dwarfmonitor` (e.g. the current date and number of happy/unhappy dwarves), the overlay that highlights suspended buildings when you pause, and others. See `overlay-dev-guide` for details.
- `channel-safely`: auto-manage channel designations to keep dwarves safe

## Fixes

- `autofarm`: flush output so status text is visible immediately after running the command
- `hotkeys`: correctly detect hotkeys bound to number keys, F11, and F12
- `labormanager`: associate quern construction with the correct labor
- ``EventManager``: fix a segmentation fault with the ``REPORT`` event
- ``EventManager``: fix the ``JOB_STARTED`` event only sending events to the first handler listed instead of all registered handlers
- Core: ensure ``foo.init`` always runs before ``foo.*.init`` (e.g. ``dfhack.init`` should always run before ``dfhack.something.init``)

## Misc Improvements
- `autolabor`, `autohauler`: refactored to use DFHack's messaging system for info/debug/trace messages
- `blueprint`: new ``--smooth`` option for recording all smoothed floors and walls instead of just the ones that require smoothing for later carving
- `blueprint`: record built constructions in blueprints
- `blueprint`: record stockpile/building/zone names in blueprints
- `blueprint`: record room sizes in blueprints
- `blueprint`: generate meta blueprints to reduce the number of blueprints you have to apply
- `blueprint`: support splitting the output file into phases grouped by when they can be applied

- `dwarfmonitor`: widgets have been ported to the overlay framework and can be enabled and configured via the `gui/overlay` UI
- `ls`: indent tag listings and wrap them in the rightmost column for better readability
- `ls`: new ``--exclude`` option for hiding matched scripts from the output. this can be especially useful for modders who don't want their mod scripts to be included in ``ls`` output.
- `hotkeys`: hotkey screen has been transformed into an interactive `overlay` widget that you can bring up by moving the mouse cursor over the hotspot (in the upper left corner of the screen by default). Enable/disable/reposition the hotspot in the `gui/overlay` UI. Even if the hotspot is disabled, the menu can be brought up at any time with the Ctrl-Shift-C hotkey.
- `hotkeys`: now supports printing active hotkeys to the console with ``hotkeys list``
- `digtype`: new ``-z`` option for digtype to restrict designations to the current z-level and down
- UX: List widgets now have mouse-interactive scrollbars
- UX: You can now hold down the mouse button on a scrollbar to make it scroll multiple times.
- UX: You can now drag the scrollbar up and down to scroll to a specific spot
- `orders`: replace shell craft orders in the standard orders list you get with ``orders import library/basic``  with orders for shell leggings. They have a slightly higher trade price. Also, "shleggings" is just hilarious.
- `spectate`: new ``auto-unpause`` option for auto-dismissal of announcement pause events (e.g. sieges).
- `spectate`: new ``auto-disengage`` option for auto-disengagement of plugin through player interaction whilst unpaused.

  - ``isInvader()``
  - ``isDemon()`` returns true for unique/regular demons
  - ``isTitan()``
  - ``isMegabeast()``
  - ``isGreatDanger()`` returns true if unit is a demon, titan, or megabeast
  - ``isSemiMegabeast()``
  - ``isNightCreature()``

- Units module: new action timer API for speeding up of slowing down units
- Constructions module: added ``insert()`` to insert constructions into the game's sorted list.
- MiscUtils: added the following string transformation functions (refactored from ``uicommon.h``): ``int_to_string``, ``ltrim``, ``rtrim``, and ``trim``; added ``string_to_int``

## Lua
- ``widgets.Scrollbar``: new scrollbar widget that can be paired with an associated scrollable widget. Integrated with ``widgets.Label`` and ``widgets.List``.

- ``widgets.ResizingPanel``: now accounts for frame inset when calculating frame size
- ``widgets.HotkeyLabel``: now ignores mouse clicks when ``on_activate`` is not defined
- ``gui.Screen.show()``: now returns ``self`` as a convenience
- ``gui.View.getMousePos()`` now takes an optional ``ViewRect`` parameter in case the caller wants to get the mouse pos relative to a rect that is not the frame_body (such as the frame_rect that includes the frame itself)
- Lua mouse events now conform to documented behavior in `lua-api` -- ``_MOUSE_L_DOWN`` will be sent exactly once per mouse click and ``_MOUSE_L`` will be sent repeatedly as long as the button is held down. Similarly for right mouse button events.

## Internals
- Constructions module: ``findAtTile`` now uses a binary search intead of a linear search
- MSVC warning level upped to /W3, and /WX added to make warnings cause compilations to fail.

## Removed
- `resume`: functionality (including suspended building overlay) has moved to `unsuspend`

# 0.47.05-r7

## New Plugins
- `autonestbox`: split off from `zone` into its own plugin. Note that to enable, the command has changed from ``autonestbox start`` to ``enable autonestbox``.
- `autobutcher`: split off from `zone` into its own plugin. Note that to enable, the command has changed from ``autobutcher start`` to ``enable autobutcher``.
- `overlay`: display a "DFHack" button in the lower left corner that you can click to start the new GUI command launcher. The `dwarfmonitor` weather display had to be moved to make room for the button. If you are seeing the weather indicator rendered over the overlay button, please remove the ``dfhack-config/dwarfmonitor.json`` file to fix the weather indicator display offset.

## New Internal Commands
- `tags`: new built-in command to list the tool category tags and their definitions. tags associated with each tool are visible in the tool help and in the output of `ls`.

## Fixes
- `autochop`: designate largest trees for chopping first, instead of the smallest
- ``dfhack.run_script``: ensure the arguments passed to scripts are always strings. This allows other scripts to call ``run_script`` with numeric args and it won't break parameter parsing.
- `dig-now`: Fix direction of smoothed walls when adjacent to a door or floodgate
- ``job.removeJob()``: ensure jobs are removed from the world list when they are canceled
- `quickfort`: `Dreamfort <quickfort-blueprint-guide>` blueprint set: declare the hospital zone before building the coffer; otherwise DF fails to stock the hospital with materials
- ``dfhack.buildings.findCivzonesAt``: no longer return duplicate civzones after loading a save with existing civzones

## Misc Improvements
- Init scripts: ``dfhack.init`` and other init scripts have moved to ``dfhack-config/init/``. If you have customized your ``dfhack.init`` file and want to keep your changes, please move the part that you have customized to the new location at ``dfhack-config/init/dfhack.init``. If you do not have changes that you want to keep, do not copy anything, and the new defaults will be used automatically.
- History files: ``dfhack.history``, ``tiletypes.history``, ``lua.history``, and ``liquids.history`` have moved to the ``dfhack-config`` directory. If you'd like to keep the contents of your current history files, please move them to ``dfhack-config``.
- `do-job-now`: new global keybinding for boosting the priority of the jobs associated with the selected building/work order/unit/item etc.: Alt-N
- `gui/workorder-details`: new keybinding on the workorder details screen: ``D``
- `keybinding`: support backquote (\`) as a hotkey (and assign the hotkey to the new `gui/launcher` interface)
- `ls`: can now filter tools by substring or tag. note that dev scripts are hidden by default. pass the ``--dev`` option to show them.
- `manipulator`: add a library of useful default professions
- `manipulator`: move professions configuration from ``professions/`` to ``dfhack-config/professions/`` to keep it together with other dfhack configuration. If you have saved professions that you would like to keep, please manually move them to the new folder.
- ``materials.ItemTraitsDialog``: added a default ``on_select``-handler which toggles the traits.
- `orders`: added useful library of manager orders. see them with ``orders list`` and import them with, for example, ``orders import library/basic``
- `prospect`: add new ``--show`` option to give the player control over which report sections are shown. e.g. ``prospect all --show ores`` will just show information on ores.
- `seedwatch`: ``seedwatch all`` now adds all plants with seeds to the watchlist, not just the "basic" crops.
- UX: You can now move the cursor around in DFHack text fields in ``gui/`` scripts (e.g. `gui/blueprint`, `gui/quickfort`, or `gui/gm-editor`). You can move the cursor by clicking where you want it to go with the mouse or using the Left/Right arrow keys.  Ctrl+Left/Right will move one word at a time, and Alt+Left/Right will move to the beginning/end of the text.
- UX: You can now click on the hotkey hint text in many ``gui/`` script windows to activate the hotkey, like a button. Not all scripts have been updated to use the clickable widget yet, but you can try it in `gui/blueprint` or `gui/quickfort`.
- UX: Label widget scroll icons are replaced with scrollbars that represent the percentage of text on the screen and move with the position of the visible text, just like web browser scrollbars.
- `quickfort`: `Dreamfort <quickfort-blueprint-guide>` blueprint set improvements: set traffic designations to encourage dwarves to eat cooked food instead of raw ingredients

## Documentation
- Added `modding-guide`
- Update all DFHack tool documentation (300+ pages) with standard syntax formatting, usage examples, and overall clarified text.
- Group DFHack tools by `tag <tools>` so similar tools are grouped and easy to find

## API
- Removed "egg" ("eggy") hook support (Linux only). The only remaining method of hooking into DF is by interposing SDL calls, which has been the method used by all binary releases of DFHack.
- Removed ``Engravings`` module (C++-only). Access ``world.engravings`` directly instead.
- Removed ``Notes`` module (C++-only). Access ``ui.waypoints.points`` directly instead.
- Removed ``Windows`` module (C++-only) - unused.
- ``Constructions`` module (C++-only): removed ``t_construction``, ``isValid()``, ``getCount()``, ``getConstruction()``, and ``copyConstruction()``. Access ``world.constructions`` directly instead.
- ``Gui::getSelectedItem()``, ``Gui::getAnyItem()``: added support for the artifacts screen
- ``Units::teleport()``: now sets ``unit.idle_area`` to discourage units from walking back to their original location (or teleporting back, if using `fastdwarf`)

## Lua
- History: added ``dfhack.getCommandHistory(history_id, history_filename)`` and ``dfhack.addCommandToHistory(history_id, history_filename, command)`` so gui scripts can access a commandline history without requiring a terminal.
- Added ``dfhack.screen.hideGuard()``: exposes the C++ ``Screen::Hide`` to Lua
- ``helpdb``: database and query interface for DFHack tool help text
- ``tile-material``: fix the order of declarations. The ``GetTileMat`` function now returns the material as intended (always returned nil before). Also changed the license info, with permission of the original author.
- ``utils.df_expr_to_ref()``: fixed some errors that could occur when navigating tables
- ``widgets.EditField``: new ``onsubmit2`` callback attribute is called when the user hits Shift-Enter.
- ``widgets.EditField``: new function: ``setCursor(position)`` sets the input cursor.
- ``widgets.EditField``: new attribute: ``ignore_keys`` lets you ignore specified characters if you want to use them as hotkeys
- ``widgets.FilteredList``: new attribute: ``edit_ignore_keys`` gets passed to the filter EditField as ``ignore_keys``
- ``widgets.Label``: ``scroll`` function now interprets the keywords ``+page``, ``-page``, ``+halfpage``, and ``-halfpage`` in addition to simple positive and negative numbers.
- ``widgets.HotkeyLabel``: clicking on the widget will now call ``on_activate()``.
- ``widgets.CycleHotkeyLabel``: clicking on the widget will now cycle the options and trigger ``on_change()``. This also applies to the ``ToggleHotkeyLabel`` subclass.

# 0.47.05-r6

## Fixes
- `eventful`: fix ``eventful.registerReaction`` to correctly pass ``call_native`` argument thus allowing canceling vanilla item creation. Updated related documentation.
- `eventful`: renamed NEW_UNIT_ACTIVE event to UNIT_NEW_ACTIVE to match the ``EventManager`` event name
- `eventful`: fixed UNIT_NEW_ACTIVE event firing too often
- ``job.removeJob()``: fixes regression in DFHack 0.47.05-r5 where items/buildings associated with the job were not getting disassociated when the job is removed. Now `build-now` can build buildings and `gui/mass-remove` can cancel building deconstruction again
- ``widgets.CycleHotkeyLabel``: allow initial option values to be specified as an index instead of an option value

## Misc Improvements
- `confirm`: added a confirmation dialog for removing manager orders

- `dfhack-examples-guide`: reduce required stock of dye for "Dye cloth" orders
- `dfhack-examples-guide`: fix material conditions for making jugs and pots
- `dfhack-examples-guide`: make wooden jugs by default to differentiate them from other stone tools. this allows players to more easily select jugs out with a properly-configured stockpile (i.e. the new ``woodentools`` alias)
- `quickfort-alias-guide`: new aliases: ``forbidsearch``, ``permitsearch``, and ``togglesearch`` use the `search-plugin` plugin to alter the settings for a filtered list of item types when configuring stockpiles
- `quickfort-alias-guide`: new aliases: ``stonetools`` and ``woodentools``.  the ``jugs`` alias is deprecated. please use ``stonetools`` instead, which is the same as the old ``jugs`` alias.
- `quickfort-alias-guide`: new aliases: ``usablehair``, ``permitusablehair``, and ``forbidusablehair`` alter settings for the types of hair/wool that can be made into cloth: sheep, llama, alpaca, and troll. The ``craftrefuse`` aliases have been altered to use this alias as well.
- `quickfort-alias-guide`: new aliases: ``forbidthread``, ``permitthread``, ``forbidadamantinethread``, ``permitadamantinethread``, ``forbidcloth``, ``permitcloth``, ``forbidadamantinecloth``, and ``permitadamantinecloth`` give you more control how adamantine-derived items are stored
- `quickfort`: `Dreamfort <quickfort-blueprint-guide>` blueprint set improvements: automatically create tavern, library, and temple locations (restricted to residents only by default), automatically associate the rented rooms with the tavern
- `quickfort`: `Dreamfort <quickfort-blueprint-guide>` blueprint set improvements: new design for the services level, including were-bitten hospital recovery rooms and an appropriately-themed interrogation room next to the jail! Also fits better in a 1x1 embark for minimalist players.

## API
- ``word_wrap``: argument ``bool collapse_whitespace`` converted to enum ``word_wrap_whitespace_mode mode``, with valid modes ``WSMODE_KEEP_ALL``, ``WSMODE_COLLAPSE_ALL``, and ``WSMODE_TRIM_LEADING``.

## Lua
- ``gui.View``: all ``View`` subclasses (including all ``Widgets``) can now acquire keyboard focus with the new ``View:setFocus()`` function. See docs for details.

- ``widgets.EditField``: the ``key_sep`` string is now configurable
- ``widgets.EditField``: can now display an optional string label in addition to the activation key
- ``widgets.EditField``: views that have an ``EditField`` subview no longer need to manually manage the ``EditField`` activation state and input routing.  This is now handled automatically by the new ``gui.View`` keyboard focus subsystem.
- ``widgets.HotkeyLabel``: the ``key_sep`` string is now configurable

# 0.47.05-r5

- `debug`: script execution log messages (e.g. "Loading script: dfhack_extras.init" can now be controlled with the ``debugfilter`` command. To hide the messages, add this line to your ``dfhack.init`` file: ``debugfilter set Warning core script``
- `dfhack-examples-guide`: add mugs to ``basic`` manager orders
- `dfhack-examples-guide`: ``onMapLoad_dreamfort.init`` remove "cheaty" commands and new tweaks that are now in the default ``dfhack.init-example`` file

- ``Job::removeJob()``: use the job cancel vmethod graciously provided by The Toady One in place of a synthetic method derived from reverse engineering

## Lua
- `custom-raw-tokens`: library for accessing tokens added to raws by mods
- ``dfhack.units``: Lua wrappers for functions reverse-engineered from ambushing unit code: ``isHidden(unit)``, ``isFortControlled(unit)``, ``getOuterContainerRef(unit)``, ``getOuterContainerRef(item)``
- ``dialogs``: ``show*`` functions now return a reference to the created dialog
- ``dwarfmode.enterSidebarMode()``: passing ``df.ui_sidebar_mode.DesignateMine`` now always results in you entering ``DesignateMine`` mode and not ``DesignateChopTrees``, even when you looking at the surface (where the default designation mode is ``DesignateChopTrees``)

## Misc Improvements
- Core: DFHack now prints the name of the init script it is running to the console and stderr
- `automaterial`: ensure construction tiles are laid down in order when using `buildingplan` to plan the constructions
- `blueprint`: all blueprint phases are now written to a single file, using `quickfort` multi-blueprint file syntax. to get the old behavior of each phase in its own file, pass the ``--splitby=phase`` parameter to ``blueprint``
- `blueprint`: you can now specify the position where the cursor should be when the blueprint is played back with `quickfort` by passing the ``--playback-start`` parameter
- `blueprint`: generated blueprints now have labels so `quickfort` can address them by name
- `blueprint`: all building types are now supported
- `blueprint`: multi-type stockpiles are now supported
- `blueprint`: non-rectangular stockpiles and buildings are now supported
- `blueprint`: blueprints are no longer generated for phases that have nothing to do (unless those phases are explicitly enabled on the commandline or gui)
- `blueprint`: new "track" phase that discovers and records carved tracks
- `blueprint`: new "zone" phase that discovers and records activity zones, including custom configuration for ponds, gathering, and hospitals
- `dig-now`: no longer leaves behind a designated tile when a tile was designated beneath a tile designated for channeling
- `orders`: added ``list`` subcommand to show existing exported orders
- `quickfort`, `dfhack-examples-guide`: Dreamfort blueprint set improvements based on playtesting and feedback. includes updated profession definitions.
- `quickfort-library-guide`: added light aquifer tap and pump stack blueprints (with step-by-step usage guides) to the quickfort blueprint library
- `quickfort`: Dreamfort blueprint set improvements: added iron and flux stock level indicators on the industry level and a prisoner processing quantum stockpile in the surface barracks. also added help text for how to manage sieges and how to manage prisoners after a siege.

## API
- ``Buildings::findCivzonesAt()``: lookups now complete in constant time instead of linearly scanning through all civzones in the game

## Lua
- ``argparse.processArgsGetopt()``: you can now have long form parameters that are not an alias for a short form parameter. For example, you can now have a parameter like ``--longparam`` without needing to have an equivalent one-letter ``-l`` param.
- ``dwarfmode.enterSidebarMode()``: ``df.ui_sidebar_mode.DesignateMine`` is now a suported target sidebar mode

## Removed
- `fortplan`: please use `quickfort` instead

# 0.47.05-r3

## New Plugins
- `dig-now`: instantly completes dig designations (including smoothing and carving tracks)

## Fixes
- Core: ``alt`` keydown state is now cleared when DF loses and regains focus, ensuring the ``alt`` modifier state is not stuck on for systems that don't send standard keyup events in response to ``alt-tab`` window manager events
- Lua: ``memscan.field_offset()``: fixed an issue causing `devel/export-dt-ini` to crash sometimes, especially on Windows
- `autofarm`: autofarm will now count plant growths as well as plants toward its thresholds
- `autogems`: no longer assigns gem cutting jobs to workshops with gem cutting prohibited in the workshop profile

## Misc Improvements
- `buildingplan`: now displays which items are attached and which items are still missing for planned buildings
- `orders`: support importing and exporting reaction-specific item conditions, like "lye-containing" for soap production orders
- `orders`: new ``sort`` command. sorts orders according to their repeat frequency. this prevents daily orders from blocking other orders for simlar items from ever getting completed.
- `tiletypes-here`, `tiletypes-here-point`: add ``--cursor`` and ``--quiet`` options to support non-interactive use cases
- `quickfort`: Dreamfort blueprint set improvements: extensive revision based on playtesting and feedback. includes updated ``onMapLoad_dreamfort.init`` settings file, enhanced automation orders, and premade profession definitions.  see full changelog at https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/pull/1921 and https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/pull/1925
- `tailor`: allow user to specify which materials to be used, and in what order

## API
- The ``Items`` module ``moveTo*`` and ``remove`` functions now handle projectiles

## Lua
- new global function: ``safe_pairs(iterable[, iterator_fn])`` will iterate over the ``iterable`` (a table or iterable userdata)  with the ``iterator_fn`` (``pairs`` if not otherwise specified) if iteration is possible. If iteration is not possible or would throw an error, for example if ``nil`` is passed as the ``iterable``, the iteration is just silently skipped.

## Documentation
- `quickfort-library-guide`: updated dreamfort documentation and added screenshots
- `dfhack-examples-guide`: documentation for all of `dreamfort`'s supporting files (useful for all forts, not just Dreamfort!)

# 0.47.05-r2

## Fixes
- Fixed an issue where scrollable text in Lua-based screens could prevent other widgets from scrolling
- Fixed an issue preventing some external scripts from creating zones and other abstract buildings (see note about room definitions under "Internals")
- `buildingplan`: fixed an issue where planned constructions designated with DF's sizing keys (``umkh``) would sometimes be larger than requested
- `buildingplan`: fixed an issue preventing other plugins like `automaterial` from planning constructions if the "enable all" buildingplan setting was turned on
- `buildingplan`: made navigation keys work properly in the materials selection screen when alternate keybindings are used
- `command-prompt`: fixed issues where overlays created by running certain commands (e.g. `gui/liquids`, `gui/teleport`) would not update the parent screen correctly
- `dwarfvet`: fixed a crash that could occur with hospitals overlapping with other buildings in certain ways
- `orders`: fixed crash when importing orders with malformed IDs
- ``quickfortress.csv`` blueprint: fixed refuse stockpile config and prevented stockpiles from covering stairways
- `stonesense`: fixed a crash that could occur when ctrl+scrolling or closing the Stonesense window
- `embark-assistant`: fixed faulty early exit in first search attempt when searching for waterfalls

## Misc Improvements
- Added adjectives to item selection dialogs, used in tools like `gui/create-item` - this makes it possible to differentiate between different types of high/low boots, shields, etc. (some of which are procedurally generated)
- `blueprint`: made ``depth`` and ``name`` parameters optional. ``depth`` now defaults to ``1`` (current level only) and ``name`` defaults to "blueprint"
- `blueprint`: ``depth`` can now be negative, which will result in the blueprints being written from the highest z-level to the lowest. Before, blueprints were always written from the lowest z-level to the highest.
- `blueprint`: added the ``--cursor`` option to set the starting coordinate for the generated blueprints. A game cursor is no longer necessary if this option is used.
- `quickfort`: the Dreamfort blueprint set can now be comfortably built in a 1x1 embark
- `stonesense`: sped up startup time
- `tweak` hide-priority: changed so that priorities stay hidden (or visible) when exiting and re-entering the designations menu
- `embark-assistant`: slightly improved performance of surveying and improved code a little

## Lua
- new string utility functions:
    - ``string:wrap(width)`` wraps a string at space-separated word boundaries
    - ``string:trim()`` removes whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the string
    - ``string:split(delimiter, plain)`` splits a string with the given delimiter and returns a table of substrings. if ``plain`` is specified and set to ``true``, ``delimiter`` is interpreted as a literal string instead of as a pattern (the default)
- new library: ``argparse`` is a collection of commandline argument processing functions
- ``gui.Painter``: fixed error when calling ``viewport()`` method
- ``gui.dwarfmode``: new function: ``enterSidebarMode(sidebar_mode, max_esc)`` which uses keypresses to get into the specified sidebar mode from whatever the current screen is
- `reveal`: now exposes ``unhideFlood(pos)`` functionality to Lua
- new utility function: ``utils.normalizePath()``: normalizes directory slashes across platoforms to ``/`` and coaleses adjacent directory separators
- ``argparse.processArgsGetopt()`` (previously ``utils.processArgsGetopt()``):
    - now returns negative numbers (e.g. ``-10``) in the list of positional parameters instead of treating it as an option string equivalent to ``-1 -0``
    - now properly handles ``--`` like GNU ``getopt`` as a marker to treat all further parameters as non-options
    - now detects when required arguments to long-form options are missing
- `xlsxreader`: added Lua class wrappers for the xlsxreader plugin API

## API
- Added ``dfhack.units.teleport(unit, pos)``
- Added ``dfhack.maps.getPlantAtTile(x, y, z)`` and ``dfhack.maps.getPlantAtTile(pos)``, and updated ``dfhack.gui.getSelectedPlant()`` to use it

## Documentation
- Added more client library implementations to the `remote interface docs <remote-client-libs>`

## Internals
- The DFHack test harness is now much easier to use for iterative development.  Configuration can now be specified on the commandline, there are more test filter options, and the test harness can now easily rerun tests that have been run before.
- The ``test/main`` command to invoke the test harness has been renamed to just ``test``
- Unit tests must now match any output expected to be printed via ``dfhack.printerr()``
- Unit tests now support fortress mode (allowing tests that require a fortress map to be loaded) - note that these tests are skipped by continuous integration for now, pending a suitable test fortress
- Unit tests can now use ``delay_until(predicate_fn, timeout_frames)`` to delay until a condition is met
- Room definitions and extents are now created for abstract buildings so callers don't have to initialize the room structure themselves

# 0.47.05-r1

## Fixes
- `confirm`: stopped exposing alternate names when convicting units
- `prospector`: improved pre embark rough estimates, particularly for small clusters

## Misc Improvements
- `autohauler`: allowed the ``Alchemist`` labor to be enabled in `manipulator` and other labor screens so it can be used for its intended purpose of flagging that no hauling labors should be assigned to a dwarf. Before, the only way to set the flag was to use an external program like Dwarf Therapist.
- `embark-assistant`: slightly improved performance of surveying
- `quickfort`: Dreamfort blueprint set improvements: `significant <http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=176889.msg8239017#msg8239017>`_ refinements across the entire blueprint set. Dreamfort is now much faster, much more efficient, and much easier to use. The `checklist <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13PVZ2h3Mm3x_G1OXQvwKd7oIR2lK4A1Ahf6Om1kFigw/edit#gid=1459509569>`__ now includes a mini-walkthrough for quick reference. The spreadsheet now also includes `embark profile suggestions <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13PVZ2h3Mm3x_G1OXQvwKd7oIR2lK4A1Ahf6Om1kFigw/edit#gid=149144025>`__

## Lua
- ``dfhack.run_command()``: changed to interface directly with the console when possible, which allows interactive commands and commands that detect the console encoding to work properly
- ``processArgsGetopt()`` added to utils.lua, providing a callback interface for parameter parsing and getopt-like flexibility for parameter ordering and combination (see docs in ``library/lua/utils.lua`` and ``library/lua/3rdparty/alt_getopt.lua`` for details).

## Documentation
- Added documentation for Lua's ``dfhack.run_command()`` and variants

- `buildingplan`: added new global settings for whether generic building materials should match blocks, boulders, logs, and/or bars - defaults are everything but bars
- `embark-assistant`: split the lair types displayed on the local map into mound, burrow, and lair
