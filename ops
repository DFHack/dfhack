Try the DFHack console instead.\n\nAlso, I assume \"0.44.06-alpha1-Linux-64-gcc-7\" should be 0.44.07, because DFHack for 0.44.06 doesn't work with DF 0.44.07.\n\nAs for the documentation, it says that Ctrl-A is bound to `exportlegends all` in the `legends` screen. `open-legends` makes its own screen, so that binding won't work there. I'm not sure how to make the documentation more complete, but feel free to make suggestions.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"10fc4673e662a5a4f9bc9e0bab204f246387c44e"},"timestamp":1521391595,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDAxNDg4Mg==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1241#issuecomment-374014882"},"message":"Yeah, missed a buttong there, fixed.\nIt works from console, thanks! :)\nDocumentation:\n* `exportlegends all` binding section I would add `(doesn't work in open-legends)`\n* `open-legends` section I would add `(use console)`... or something :)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1521398485,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDAzMDg4MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1241#issuecomment-374030880"},"message":"The keybindings in the documentation are automatically generated from dfhack.init-example.
