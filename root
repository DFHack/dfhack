However, it seems the way dfhack's launch script is, I cannot do this. Also, even though I specified this library during build at the advanced section of ccmake, the issue persists.\n\nThe error presents itself in the exact same manner in which it does on a vanilla install. This is a popup box titled \"tileset not found\" and the content of \"Not found: data/art/curses_640x300.png\".\n\nSwitching to .bmp does not fix this, nor does using a graphics set.\n\nPlease advise.","files":null}]}
