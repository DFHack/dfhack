Welcome to DFHack's documentation!
==================================

Introduction
============
DFHack is a Dwarf Fortress memory access library, distributed with scripts
and plugins implementing a wide variety of useful functions and tools.

For users, it provides a significant suite of bugfixes and interface
enhancements by default, and more can be enabled.  There are also many tools
(such as `plugins/workflow` or `plugins/autodump`) which can make life easier.
You can even add third-party scripts and plugins to do almost anything!

For modders, DFHack makes many things possible.  Custom reactions, new
interactions, magic creature abilities, and more can be set through `scripts <scripts/modtools>`
and custom raws.  Non-standard DFHack scripts and inits can be stored in the
raw directory, making raws or saves fully self-contained for distribution -
or for coexistence in a single DF install, even with incompatible components.

For developers, DFHack unites the various ways tools access DF memory and
allows easier development of new tools.  As an open-source project under
`various copyleft licences <license>`, contributions are welcome.
