Manual suspending/resuming does not resolve the issue, using \"now!\" or moving jobs around in the list does nothing too. Marking workshop for removal and stopping removal, after which jobs get restored in suspended state, and then resuming them manually doesn't seem to reliably solve the issue. Canceling repeat, cancelling the job and then adding the job back manually solves the problem for time being.\nExample save (dfhack 0.40.23-r1): http://kimitsudesu.net/files/df/region1.zip\nOn level -4 there is a clothier's workshop with bunch of resumed jobs that are ignored even though most of the dwarfs have that labor active. Note that there is another clothier's workshop to the left of it. It had the same set of jobs and they were supposed to work in parallel, but in fact only one of them worked and the other got stuck. To isolate the issue I cleared all jobs from the one workshop that worked.","files":null}]}
