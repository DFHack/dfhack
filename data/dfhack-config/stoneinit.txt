--Interface--

Sets the width and height of the application in pixels.
[WIDTH:800]
[HEIGHT:600]

To launch the application in windowed mode, set this to YES.
Setting it to NO makes the program attempt to launch fullscreen mode,
using WIDTH and HEIGHT for resolution. Try and use resolutions compatible
with your drivers, or the program will still load in window mode.
[WINDOWED:YES]

Each entry expects the number of tiles to load.

[SHOW_FOG:YES]
[FOG_RED:128]
[FOG_GREEN:158]
[FOG_BLUE:177]
[FOG_ALPHA:30]

Background color. setting this the same as the fog color produces a nice effect.
[BACK_RED:128]
[BACK_GREEN:158]
[BACK_BLUE:177]

This value, in milliseconds, is how long Stonesense waits between
reloading the map. If zero, the autoreload will be disabled until

ready when Stonesense loads.
[AUTO_RELOAD_TIME:50]

Amount to change the auto reload time with each press of Numpad+/-
[AUTO_RELOAD_STEP:50]

Amount of time, in milliseconds, before the animation swaps to the next frame.

Adds more logging information to what is written to stonesense.log. May be useful
if trying having issues with sprite configuration tweaking.
[VERBOSE_LOGGING:NO]

--Troubleshooting--

This is the number of draw operations that will be held at a time.  Holding draw operations allows
for those draws to be carried out efficiently if they have the same source.  May be tweaked for
performance gains.
[BITMAP_HOLDS:4096]

Stonesense will try to merge all loaded sprites into a single texture, for performance reasons.
if your videocard has low memory, you may want to disable this.

This sets the preferred size of the internal image cache. If your videocard does not support it,
a smaller size is used.
[IMAGE_CACHE_SIZE:4096]

If this is set to YES, Stonesense will save a copy of the image cache each time something is added to it.
Dot NOT turn this on unless something is going very wonky. this will slow loading times considerably,
and possibly quickly fill up yout hard-drive.

Set the preferred renderer. Valid values are SOFTWARE, OPENGL, DIRECTX, and ANY. SOFTWARE has the highest
compatibility, but is very slow.
[RENDERER:ANY]
