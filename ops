Add support for grouping of related addresses/offsets/values in the Entries -- DONE\n2. Add a Meta entry that normal entries are based upon. This contains mostly meta-data for the actual entries. There's a tendency towards this already, so let's make it official. Addresses, Offsets and Hexvalues should have descriptions. -- DONE\n3. Create a GUI tool to make working with the Memory.xml file(s) effective.\n4. All tags should be able to have dependencies on other tags.\n   All tags should be able to use hexsearch strings. Those should be used mostly in meta entries.\n   For example:\n\n\u003cAddress name=\"WORLD\"\u003e0x123456\u003c/Address\u003e\n\n\u003cAddress name=\"Something\" offsetfrom=\"WORLD + 0x100\" /\u003e\n\n\u003cAddress name=\"Something else\" hexsearch=\"FORMAT UNDECIDED\" /\u003e","files":null}]}
