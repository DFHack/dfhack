Currently, what I'd have to do is go through the material filter and select every single stone that's colored the color I want (dark gray, so a lot). The way the material filter system is managed also seems to prevent me from choosing materials across categories too - such as steel as another option with all the stone. As such, it would be really neat to add a new filter for tile color, so I can set \"dark gray\" and be done.","files":null}]}
