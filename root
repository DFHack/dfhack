It would also be nice to watch eggs of certain creatures, although this could also be influenced by restricting nestboxes to certain creatures (I don't remember to what extent this is possible in DF).\n\nhttps://github.com/lethosor/dfhack/tree/nestbox-guard may work, although it doesn't reliably cancel egg hauling jobs that already have a worker, from what I remember.","files":null}]}
