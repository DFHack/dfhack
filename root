There are a couple options here:\n- Move it back to the root directory. I'm not sure how well this would work with Sphinx, though.\n- Move it to a `.github` folder (should work, according to [this](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/))\n- Symlink either of those paths to docs/Contributing.rst - this could cause issues if anyone tries to modify it on Windows, and I don't know for sure if GitHub will handle it.\n\nThoughts?","files":null}]}
