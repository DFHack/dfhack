In early game, a play session could last 5 years, and many things could get done, but in late game you could spend an entire session in just one season with your dwarves testing your patience.\n\nIt seems to me that even in extremely low FPS, fastdwarf causes dwarves to behave about the same as their 100 FPS counterpart, if not a lot better.  Is it feasible to make a plugin which applies fastdwarf globally (ie to all the creatures on the map, not just citizens) while also speeding up the calendar based on the ratio of 100 and the current FPS?\n\nYou would still have GUI lag, slower world \u0026 environment checks, etc.","files":null}]}
