Completely burys my fort.","message":"I am gonna let the file I post speak about the issue more deeply then I will speak here. I am posting this here as another player also thought this could be a DF Hack bug as the entire map is reveals after the bug takes place.\n\nThere is a save file on DFFD that is primed to show this bug off, it shoudl trigger, unaggitated, within 7 days at least.\n\nPlease read the description of the file before downloading. I did provide as much info as I could, but would be happy to help with anymore more.\n\nAt a loss on what to do next....I haven't debugged DF like I have for other games like MC and such, so I am not sure of the tools I could use to get more info..\n\nFortunately, the file is public, and smarter people can do it faster then I could with better results.\n\nRubble is also on this, so if it is determined not to be DF, thats my next stop.","files":null}]}
