command-prompt
==============
An in-game DFHack terminal, where you can enter other commands.

:dfhack-keybind:`command-prompt`

Usage: ``command-prompt [entry]``

If called with an entry, it starts with that text filled in.
Most useful for developers, who can set a keybinding to open
a laungage interpreter for lua or Ruby by starting with the
`:lua <lua>` or `:rb <rb>` commands.

Otherwise somewhat similar to `gui/quickcmd`.
