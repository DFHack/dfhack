However, my fortress doesn't allow militia to carry food, and after getting suspicious I noted the latest case being someone whose task is \"eat\". There is probably a need to check if food is actually dropped or placed on (inside, as it's viewable with 't') a table to eat it.\nI don't see any bad effects from this, though.\n\nI'm not sure which script it is, as it's one activated by the LNP with one of the standard settings.","files":null}]}
