forceequip
==========
Forceequip moves local items into a unit's inventory.  It is typically used to
equip specific clothing/armor items onto a dwarf, but can also be used to put
armor onto a war animal or to add unusual items (such as crowns) to any unit.

For more information run ``forceequip help``.  See also `modtools/equip-item`.
