Drop the `dfhack-run` starting each line, and then to import `script autobutcher.txt` is a native DFHack command, there's no need for an external shell, and it works identically on each platform.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1424049590,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDQ4NTcy","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/554#issuecomment-74448572"},"message":"Ah, that makes more sense.
