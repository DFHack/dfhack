siege-engine
============
Siege engines in DF haven't been updated since the game was 2D, and can
only aim in four directions.  To make them useful above-ground,
this plugin allows you to:

* link siege engines to stockpiles
* restrict operator skill levels (like workshops)
* load any object into a catapult, not just stones
* aim at a rectangular area in any direction, and across Z-levels

The front-end is implemented by `gui/siege-engine`.
