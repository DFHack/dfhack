Tools will be able to enumerate and apply the patches.\n\nThis can use hexsearch and possibly some minimal GUI (just plain terminal app or ncurses). Someone could then write the patches or apps that use them. Converting the other apps that already exist is also a possibility - embark anywhere, setting number of dwarfs on embark, nano fort, stuff like that.","files":null}]}
