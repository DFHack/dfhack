Also ipairs like thing (vpairs?) that would list all of functions. This would greatly simplify scripting as you could lookup stuff faster instead of using xmls or headers.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1586363491,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMyMTQ4OTk4ODM="},"added":["idea"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1586363590,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTA2MTI4Mw==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1542#issuecomment-611061283"},"message":"I'm not sure how much useful information the function metatables actually have, but worth investigating.
