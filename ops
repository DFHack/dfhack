Just did a search through my own repo and there are no references to the file anywhere.  There WAS a file by this name briefly in use several months ago, and it is possible that the mac version is simply out of date.   \n\nIt would probably be more fruitful to post a link to this issue in the stonesense thread: http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=106497","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1370716650,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTUzMjcw","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/201#issuecomment-19153270"},"message":"I actually obtained this through the dfhack build â€“ the Stonesense thread doesn't even mention a Mac version.
