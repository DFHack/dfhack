It is fiddly and time-consuming to allow each plugin via the mac Security settings and relaunch dfhack.\n\nRemoving the quarantine flag from all the downloaded files prevents these alerts. After copying the extracted dfhack files into the dwarf fortress installation directory, this can be done by running the following command (replacing `df_osx` with the appropriate directory name):\n\n`find df_osx/ -print0 | xargs -0 xattr -d com.apple.quarantine`\n\nIt would of course be nice for these files to be signed so this workaround is not needed, but I'm not sure if that's on the horizon for this project. I'm happy to put up a PR to add this workaround to a readme or other documentation if that's desirable.\n\nThanks for all the hard work on this amazing project!","files":null}]}
