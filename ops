In fact, it disables farms that I have manually set to grow barley. Setting a threshold manually does not help. Looking into it, it seems to be because `df.ui.tasks.discovered_plants` is returning false for barley, though I'm not sure why. This is with 0.44.12-r2 on Win10 64 bit. Can anyone reproduce? I can provide a save file if needed.","files":null}]}
