mode
====
This command lets you see and change the game mode directly.

.. warning::

    Only use ``mode`` after making a backup of your save!

    Not all combinations are good for every situation and most of them will
    produce undesirable results. There are a few good ones though.

Examples:

  * You are in fort game mode, managing your fortress and paused.
  * You switch to the arena game mode, *assume control of a creature* and then
  * switch to adventure game mode(1).
    You just lost a fortress and gained an adventurer.  Alternatively:

  * You are in fort game mode, managing your fortress and paused at the esc menu.
  * You switch to the adventure game mode, assume control of a creature, then save or retire.
  * You just created a returnable mountain home and gained an adventurer.
