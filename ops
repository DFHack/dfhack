Either Sphinx has to pull out the text from C++ source at docs-build time, or the plugin has to pull them in from somewhere at compile time.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"f7b5a7930d0e1264ae1e4a774b03a7e78c2b7858"},"timestamp":1470830631,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NzUxMjE3NDA1"},"status":2}]}
