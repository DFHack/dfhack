This directory is for quickfort blueprints. You can apply them to your fortress
map with the DFHack
[quickfort script](https://docs.dfhack.org/en/stable/docs/_auto/base.html#quickfort).

You can create blueprints by hand or by using any spreadsheet application,
saving them as .xlsx or .csv files. You can also build your plan "for real" in
Dwarf Fortress, and then export your map using the DFHack
[blueprint plugin](https://docs.dfhack.org/en/stable/docs/Plugins.html#blueprint)
for later replay in a different fort.

DFHack blueprints are compatible with the original Quickfort 2.0 syntax. If you
have existing blueprints that worked with https://github.com/joelpt/quickfort,
then they should work just fine in DFHack quickfort.

There are many ready-to-use examples of blueprints in the library subfolder.
