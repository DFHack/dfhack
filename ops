Nothing happens regardless of which option is selected.\n\n![screenshot 2016-02-11 22 19 34](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5883232/12998084/7a3379b8-d10d-11e5-92ea-952ac91a3479.png)\n\nOf course, disabling confirm dialogs for deleting notes fixes this, but this probably wasn't intended.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Place a note and start entering its name (`N-p-n`)\n2. Type the character `d`\n\nI noticed the unrelated issue #821 while looking into this one.","files":null}]}
