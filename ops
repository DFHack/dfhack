I noticed that no dwarf would build my bridges, and the bridge jobs complained an Architect was needed.  None of my dwarfs had any experience in Architect when I assigned one as Architect.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\n1. Open Dwarf Manipulator. (`u`, `l`)\n2. Enable Building Designer for any dwarf, A, not already assigned.  Remember this dwarf's name.\n3. Return to main menu.\n4. Open profession for dwarf A.  (`u`, select dwarf A, `z`, `p`, `l`, select _Other Jobs_, `Enter`)\n5. Observe that Architect is not enabled.\n\n**Expected Behavior**\nWhen Building Designer is enabled, Architect is also enabled.","files":null}]}
