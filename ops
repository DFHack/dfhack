If there's a native way to check in advance whether the second script exists, I don't know it. \n\nThis is a problem for me at the moment because I'm working on a script which stores data (descriptions of items, creatures, and materials) as a function.  If attempting to access a script, which for a mods would be in `/raw/scripts`, failed non-fatally I could include all the vanilla config in the same file.  As is, I'll need to supply a second script with the vanilla info, and allow that to be overridden by a copy in the raws.  At best this will require some inelegant workarounds, and at least a placeholder script seems essential.","files":null}]}
