    :summary: Queue manager jobs based on free space in stockpiles.
    :tags: unavailable fort auto stockpiles workorders

With this plugin, the fortress bookkeeper can tally up free space in specific
stockpiles and queue jobs through the manager to produce items to fill the free
space.

When the plugin is enabled, the :kbd:`q` menu of each stockpile will have two
new options:

* :kbd:`j`:  Select a job to order, from an interface like the manager's screen.
* :kbd:`J`:  Cycle between several options for how many such jobs to order.

Whenever the bookkeeper updates stockpile records, new work orders will
be placed on the manager's queue for each such selection, reduced by the
number of identical orders already in the queue.

This plugin is similar to `workflow`, but uses stockpiles to manage job triggers
instead of abstract stock quantities.
