I misread that to mean the Visual Studio package should be the full one, not some limited version, and installed using the default installation. I'd probably rewrite it as \"... install Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 using the full (not default) installation option.\n\n- Python usage is described a \"Python (for documentation; optional, except for release builds)\". If my understanding is correct, \"release build\" means actually contributing to DFHack. If that is correct, I'd turn the description around to something like:\n- Python (for documentation and release builds; optional if your work is for private use only and not intended to be contributed back to DFHack).","files":null}]}
