That wouldn't solve this issue with fresh PRs, but it would for PR builds triggered after the PR has been opened and a non-PR build has been run. Not a great solution, but better than what we have now.\nWe could also set up an external service that fetches PR information with an API key (and fall back to GitHub's API, of course).","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"f7b5a7930d0e1264ae1e4a774b03a7e78c2b7858"},"timestamp":1445847435,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MTA1NjgwNQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/694#issuecomment-151056805"},"message":"Until this is properly fixed, how about accepting false negatives instead of false positives?  Most pulls are correctly targeted, it's easy to confirm manually, and getting a red mark when everything should be OK is not a good experience for contributors.  And it'll still work to catch most cases, since the problem is intermittent - and with multiple commits, it only has to work once.\n\nThis is as simple as [changing the exit code in the `except HTTPError:` block](https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/blob/develop/travis/pr-check-base.py#L24) - still print the output, just don't have it fail the build.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1446261563,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MjY4OTM0Mg==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/694#issuecomment-152689342"},"message":"Hopefully fixed in aa2ada4cbcfa64467e782f6d7fcf9ebce5712f9d","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1446261563,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDUwOTk3Mjc4"},"status":2}]}
