The 1a pile is also all skill tokens.\n\nWrestlers get 101-104 (Striker, Kicker, Biter and Wrestler skills), thieves have 40, 116 and 57 (Knife User, Climber, Ambusher). STANDARD creatures (peasants?), recruits, hunting/war animals, children, babies, drunks, monster slayers, beast hunters, scouts, mercenaries and snatchers get nothing.\n\nIf my guess is right, mangling these vectors might be a way to make immigrants ready for war with ready weapon skills, prevent people from arriving with disused/deprecated skills, make games with all-peasant immigration and more.
