# The DFHack Example Configuration File Library

This folder contains ready-to-use examples of various DFHack configuration
files. You can use them by copying them to appropriate folders where DFHack
and its plugins can find them. You can use them unmodified, or you can
customize them to better suit your preferences.

For information on each of the files in this library, see the
[DFHack Example Configuration File Guide](https://docs.dfhack.org/en/stable/docs/guides/examples-guide.html).
