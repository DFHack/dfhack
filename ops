I was explaining how to fix your issue with PRINT_MODE:TEXT.\nI would like to have Stonesense work with OpenGL print modes, but system lockups and kernel panics just aren't acceptable (and yes, these did occur on multiple dev's machines under different systems). Stonesense development isn't active at the moment, but Japa has mentioned looking into moving Stonesense to a separate process, which should resolve this issue (and many others, like input not working) and make Stonesense crashes more bearable. There's also Armok Vision, if you're interested, but it doesn't display as much information yet.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"70e0249ae71b062f7bcf42695feebbbd54abfaf7"},"timestamp":1435777692,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzc5NzQ0MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/648#issuecomment-117797440"},"message":"Okay!
