I suppose that could be clarified, but the point is that release *packages* need to include documentation, so if you're building DFHack and uploading it to GitHub for other people to use, you need to have Python installed to build the documentation. If you're working on a new plugin or something for other people to use, you don't technically have to build the documentation. However, it would be nice to document new things yourself, and try to build the docs to make sure you didn't break anything, but it's not mandatory (Travis will build the docs too).","files":null}]}
