However, in the case of ambushes, I always seem to get notified in advance by a quiet \"A vile force of darkness has arrived!\" There are a few things odd about this:\n1. It's not a full-screen \"OMG drop everything and pay attention\" notification, it's just a simple announcements, with equal priority to, say, cats having kittens.\n2. It only happens for ambushes, while that message is typically reserved for overt sieges.\n3. It shows up in the dfhack console, so I suspect it originates from there.\n\nThen, once I actually discover the ambush, the real message \"An ambush! Curse them!\" appears. This behaves as expected.\n\nMy guess is that this is something for SoundSense? I can't recall where I read it, but there are extra announcements for SoundSense's benefit (workshops completing, etc). This feels like it's along those lines (although, I can't see what purpose it might serve, since ambushes and sieges get their own announcements already).\n\n(Tangentially related to this is that the FixGrowth script also makes noise in the dfhack console when it does it's thing to the goblins as well. Technically, this also spoils that I have... let's see... 54 hidden units. But, since it doesn't make an announcement, I don't think it matters.)","files":null}]}
