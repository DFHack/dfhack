Omitting the 'r' parameter to let it auto size works, but when an 'r' is added to yield the same width they don't want to cooperate. Resizing the DF window so a List crosses gradually less of the middle causes the List to grow on the left side (up to the middle), while a Label suddenly appears when the whole frame ends up on the left side. Shrinking the DF window has the opposite effects. Zooming has the same effect as resizing. It can be noted that I've left the 'b' parameter out in both cases. A possible requirement to specify the 'b' parameter is not an issue for the Label in my case, as that tends to be fixed, but I want my Lists to be able to make use of all the vertical space available.\n\nNeither of these issues are huge problems as they can be worked around, but they're definitely odd.\n\nI'm somewhat outdated by using DFHack alpha-2, but I believe the gui.widgets file hasn't changed since then.
