Does the folder exist?\"\n\nI figured it was because it was misinterpreting the `/` character as a directory separator. This was confirmed when I attempted to give one a name beginning with `../` and found the file saved in the main Dwarf Fortress folder rather than the `stocksettings` folder.\n\nGiven that `/` can be a common character in stockpile names (as in the case I gave) I'd say this is something that ought to be fixed.\n\nPerhaps a separate \"display name\" can be added to the files that can contain characters that otherwise wouldn't be valid in filenames. At the very least the error message should be changed to something less confusing, like \"Invalid character detected in name.\"","files":null}]}
