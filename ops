I\ncould see that working, although what are the performance implications?\nWould it need to be limited to a certain number of tiles generated over a\ncertain number of seconds? something like a 30 magma-tiles per second max.\nor something?

Doing it every second or couple of seconds should be more than enough to create a decent flow. As for performance there will naturally be some point where it starts to drag down the game, but not because of dfhack placing the magma (which would be almost instantaneously if it's optimized a bit) but rather because of df calculating the flow and temperatures and whatnot. It needs to be tested, but I would assume that it should be no problem to spawn/refill hundreds or thousands or even tens of thousands tiles every second and you would barely notice it if at all. Df probably does much worse things with the map every single tick.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"4f2823b111a40d19603a11dc9e0f3c589bea0f03"},"timestamp":1349052821,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkwMTk4MTk=","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/149#issuecomment-9019819"},"message":"Added in 0.34.11-r2","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"4f2823b111a40d19603a11dc9e0f3c589bea0f03"},"timestamp":1349052821,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjU3NDUzNTQ="},"status":2},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1423175839,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzMTEyMDUwMw=="},"added":["idea"],"removed":[]}]}
