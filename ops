Try `rb df.curview.feed_keys(:SELECT)`\n- [x] Alignment - try `rb p df.world`\n\nSome scripts that have come up (and should probably be checked to make sure they don't crash before r1, etc.):\n- [x] exterminate\n- [x] growcrops\n- [x] autofarm\n- [x] ban-cooking\n- [x] deathcause (#1028)\n- [x] adaptation\n- [x] autounsuspend start","files":null}]}
