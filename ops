Was there a plant on the tile before? It would be best if you could provide a save where this happens.\n\nAnyway, try using the good old magma + water method for now. I bet it will set all the required bits properly. Placing obsidian directly was never a polished feature, more of a quick hack... and it shows.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"20b694d874766b15e6137a91b7131cbaa64faed8"},"timestamp":1289010792,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTY1MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/51#issuecomment-521650"},"message":"yeah, i think on some were plants... dead shrubs or young trees\ni can upload a save, however i can not guarantee how long it takes for another tile to vanish.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"20b694d874766b15e6137a91b7131cbaa64faed8"},"timestamp":1289057446,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjI4OA==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/51#issuecomment-522288"},"message":"here is a save: http://www.2shared.com/file/OpsQNAQP/savetar.html\nlook at the walled in area at z -2","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"4f2823b111a40d19603a11dc9e0f3c589bea0f03"},"timestamp":1349053709,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkwMTk5MzY=","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/51#issuecomment-9019936"},"message":"Alright. This lingered around forever now. This is not really a bug. You mess with the map, you end up breaking it. DFHack now has proper ways of dealing with plants - the immolate plugin for example. If you want to turn trees into something else, you can flash-burn them into ashes with that :)","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"4f2823b111a40d19603a11dc9e0f3c589bea0f03"},"timestamp":1349053709,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjU3NDU3MDE="},"status":2}]}
