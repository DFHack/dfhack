The view shows a dwarf attribute grid in the column space for 'professions' etc. It shows what attributes are affected by selected job, and it colors all jobs in three levels by how they are affected by the dwarves individual attributes. \n\nHere are two screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/TOfBo\n\nThe edit is all to manipulator.cpp in branch develop of my fork here: https://github.com/strainer/dfhack\n\nThis 'detail' mode is accessed in game by toggling through the views (press t, profession mode, squad mode) It is the last view before cycling back to standard 'profession' view.\n\nIt is working and ready to try.
