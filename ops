My manual approach is \"pulsed\", i.e. I designate 5-6 creatures for slaughter (low pop fortress), and don't designate a new batch until the butchery has been cleaned out.\nIt may be harder to implement a push-back of that kind, but it takes my fortresses considerably longer than a day to clean out the results of a single slaughtered animal. To make things worse, it seems haulers with both food and refuse hauling jobs prefer to haul off the bones and rotting food rather than saving the fresh one, resulting in a vicious circle when you get out of sync.\nI think you'd still want to slaughter animals in batches, as slaughtering one, cleaning out, slaughtering the next, etc. will lead to the butcher wandering off to do something else between the animals, resulting in a needlessly low efficiency.","files":null}]}
