With DFHack aquifers have randomly been displayed and not for v0.47, i.e. either they're all shown as DF shows them, or they're all completely suppressed, but with the current data I haven't been able to get them to show at all (5 or so attempts). I suspect it has something to do with the Sand indicator, although sand presence or absence does not affect whether aquifers are shown: they're gone (i.e. not shown: I'm sure they're still there...) thorughout the map.","files":null}]}
