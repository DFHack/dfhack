I'm using a pristine clone of this repository, without any personal changes. Nevertheless, when trying to perform the build I get the following error:\n\n    /home/katharina/git/dfhack/library/modules/Materials.cpp: In member function ‘bool \n    DFHack::Materials::ReadDescriptorColors()’:\n    /home/katharina/git/dfhack/library/modules/Materials.cpp:736:31: error: ‘struct df::world_raws’ has no \n    member named ‘descriptors’\n          size_t size = world-\u003eraws.descriptors.colors.size();\n                                    ^~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI realize that the different descriptor tables were supposed to be merged into one sub-struct member called `descriptors`, and the current TWBT patches and changes in dfhack reflect that change. But for some reason, it is not present in `world_raws.h` for me.\n\nI used the the following CMake parameters:\n`cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDFHACK_BUILD_ARCH=64 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\u003cpath to my df installation\u003e`\n\nThanks in advance for any help!","files":null}]}
