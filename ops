Anyway, Quietust fixed the alignment problem in https://github.com/DFHack/df-structures/commit/d20452b9e1120e533f4e4f8ec3638f3477b52148 - it turned out that one of the fields is a bit vector, which has a different size across platforms. https://github.com/DFHack/df-structures/commit/4a3b6cd079644a2c09b6af52769966aad8509b4f added some field names - I'm assuming what used to be `anon_21` is now either `main_cursor` or `sub_cursor`.\nEdit: It's `main_cursor` - `sub_cursor` is the position of the cursor in the individual lists (e.g. historical figures).","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"f7b5a7930d0e1264ae1e4a774b03a7e78c2b7858"},"timestamp":1415484819,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMjgwOTE1","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/383#issuecomment-62280915"},"message":"Cool.
