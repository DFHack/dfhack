[this](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=161494.msg7262513#msg7262513) - it also means that graphics-specific colorschemes are overridden.\n\nIt would be nice to also support an 'automatic mode', where seasonal palettes are generated by biasing the standard colours (see links for discussion).  This could be done in memory and on demand, without any files being written.","files":null}]}
