This also clarifies my suggestion a little (you can read the lot [here](https://github.com/PeridexisErrant/roses-scripts)):\n- Merge and standardise the 'useful scripts', placing each wherever they'd fit best (modtools, fix, etc)\n- Leave out the 'systems' as too complex and versioned for most users\n\nFor example `gui/unit-info-viewer.lua` is identical to the DFhack version aside from some trailing whitespace, while `modtools/building-trigger.lua` would be a useful thing to add.  `teleport.lua` is much more capable in Roses' version.\n\nThere's a bunch of other stuff, but overall I'm starting to think we need a bigger change in the way script development is done.
