However, in practice they don't quite work.\n\nWhen specifying multiple z-levels in blueprint, only the first layer is found. CSV rows for subsequent levels are generated, but they are all empty. e.g. I was trying to do a 3x3 spiral, but it only got the first layer: `blueprint 3 3 5 3x3-spiral dig`\n\n```\n#dig\n , ,d,#\n ,h,d,#\n , ,h,#\n#\u003c\n , , ,#\n , , ,#\n , , ,#\n#\u003c\n , , ,#\n , , ,#\n , , ,#\n#\u003c\n , , ,#\n , , ,#\n , , ,#\n#\u003c\n , , ,#\n , , ,#\n , , ,#\n```\n\nSo I manually made multiple single-level csv files and combined them together to make the \"correct\" CSV export:\n\n```\n#dig\n , ,d,#\n ,h,d,#\n , ,h,#\n#\u003c\n , , ,#\n ,h, ,#\nh,d,r,#\n#\u003c\nh, , ,#\nd,h, ,#\nr, , ,#\n#\u003c\nr,d,h,#\n ,h, ,#\n , , ,#\n#\u003c\n , ,r,#\n ,h,d,#\n , ,h,#\n```\n\nThen I attempted to import this custom file using `digfort 3x3-spiral-dig.csv`. But the resulting dig operation ended up all on one floor instead of across z-leves:\n![selection_079](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/100206/13973712/f7a2df5a-f062-11e5-870d-d6a405990c8b.png)\n\nIt looks like these plugins are _almost_ there as far as z-level support, but there is a little left to adjust. Thanks for the hard work so far!","files":null}]}
