If I am using another window (Dwarf Therapist for example), and I click on Dwarf Fortress to return the focus there, it sometimes crashes with the same error message. It seems to happen before DF actually regains focus, or at least before its window is raised.\n\nI hope this helps you track it down.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"60d9d0f80c7ddbf907626b97b56b0642feab407d"},"timestamp":1392113214,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzQwNjUz","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/208#issuecomment-34740653"},"message":"This is already fixed in the mainline","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"be523fe0f95fc478bda36c722e6f106f8f7a41b5"},"timestamp":1417211948,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjAwMDcwMzUz"},"status":2},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1423090328,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzMDQxMjcwNA=="},"added":["crash/hang"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1423090342,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzMDQxMjgzMA=="},"added":["bug"],"removed":[]}]}
