autochop
========
Automatically manage tree cutting designation to keep available logs withing given
quotas.

Open the dashboard by running::

    enable autochop

The plugin must be activated (with :kbd:`d`-:kbd:`t`-:kbd:`c`-:kbd:`a`) before
it can be used. You can then set logging quotas and restrict designations to
specific burrows (with 'Enter') if desired. The plugin's activity cycle runs
once every in game day.

If you add ``enable autochop`` to your dfhack.init there will be a hotkey to
open the dashboard from the chop designation menu.
