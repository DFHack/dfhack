The number jives somewhat with the order of the professions in the labor menu, but doesn't match up with the official skill/labor token lists. \nOne example is the bowyer coming in at number 49, right past siege engineers (47) and operators (48). Umbrella professions like metalsmith and woodworker don't have their own number, but instead contain all the identifiers of their sub-professions. For instance, woodworkers have 2 (carpenter), 1 (woodcutter) and 49 (bowyer) in that order. My first guess was that they are arranged in the order they got added into the game (mining and woodcutting being first at 0 and 1, distinct clerical jobs coming in late and pottery, waxworking \u0026 gelding being dead last at 114-117), but that's just speculating.\n\n1b is weirder. The list format is the same, but most civilian professions are blank. The only values are located in the following list items, with all the values listed in order:\n- rangers and hunters (44, 105)\n- doctors, diagnosers, bone setters, suturers and surgeons (59)\n- hammer/spear/axe/swords-/mace/whipmen (105, 45, 46, 88, 116, 89)\n- blowgun/bow/crossbow/pikemen (105, 46, 88, 116, 89)\n- wrestlers (105, 88, 116, 89)\n\nThe only list the numbers seem to match is skill tokens. \nhttp://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Skill_token \nHunters have CROSSBOW and DODGING, medical professions all get WOUND_DRESSING and nothing more (notable since the distinct wound dresser profession isn't listed at all!), melee fighters aside from pikemen get DODGING, SHIELD, ARMOR, DISCIPLINE, CLIMBING and SITUATIONAL_AWARENESS, archers and pikemen have all the above except for SHIELD and wrestlers lose ARMOR as well.\n\nThe list might detail all the skills that generated characters/immigrants gain along with their single specific primary skill, but I don't have enough information to say for sure.","files":null}]}
