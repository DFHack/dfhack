It supports:\n\n```\nban-cooking booze  - bans cooking of drinks\nban-cooking honey  - bans cooking of honey bee honey\nban-cooking tallow - bans cooking of tallow\nban-cooking oil    - bans cooking of oil\nban-cooking seeds  - bans cooking of plants that have seeds (tree seeds don't count)\n```\n\nAnd as of today:\n\n```\nban-cooking brew   - bans cooking of plants that can be brewed into alcohol\nban-cooking mill   - bans cooking of plants that can be milled into powder\nban-cooking thread - bans cooking of plants that can be turned into thread\nban-cooking milk   - bans cooking of creature liquids that can be turned into cheese\n```\n\nIt doesn't unban the cooking when there's a lot of that ingredient, but it might be useful for you or anyone who might stumble upon this ticket in the future.","files":null}]}
