It might be better to just address them starting at the actual data, the pointer to the start of the vector, or the string data directly.  As it is now I have to remember to subtract 4 from all the addresses, then DFHack just adds the 4 back in.  It would take some editing of the current addresses, but if it is acceptable to you guys I will do it, I think it would save us some hassle, as well as invalid addresses because I forgot to subtract 4 :)","files":null}]}
