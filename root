One of the things DFHack is needed for is to nickname units not belonging to you (such as keeping track of quester groups to easier locate infiltrators when one of them tries to sneak attack, and the whole fortress erupts in chaos). Another usage is to name vampires identified by the arrival message (or identified otherwise). However, if they operate under a false identity, the nickname is attacked to their real name rather than the false one used.\nInterestingly, when updating the nickname, the interface shows a blank nickname, indicating it was retrieved from the false identity, not the real one it's stored to.\nPresumably, this doesn't only affect vampires, but any units operating under a false identity (including, your own migrants if you're unlucky and I've read the bug reports correctly).","files":null}]}
