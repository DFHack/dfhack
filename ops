Levers, Stone Traps, And Cage Traps only require a single mechanism to be constructed. The cage and stone traps are loaded later automatically. \n\nWeapon traps, pressure plates, and spear/spikes are multi-tiered in their construction and I would guess much more complex to implement with building plan. I can definitely understand their being forgone.\n\nThanks again for all you guys do! You are my heroes!","files":null}]}
