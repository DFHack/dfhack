End result =\u003e a significantly large quantity of the skin and meat ends up going rotten before it's had a chance to be stored away/processed.\n\nIt would be a nice enhancement to be able to specify an upper limit to the number of animals butchered in a day (e.g. like with manager orders that say \"make 3 items, check conditions daily\" which limits the production of those items to max 3 in a day - you can end up with 0, 1, 2, or 3 completed in any one day with any left over happening the next day/etc, but never more than 3 in a single day), so that sudden \"bursts\" of animals maturing doesn't result in huge bursts of meat/skin being produced that cannot usually be processed in the time available before rotting.","files":null}]}
