Since I've seen some people who don't realize this is DFHack-provided despite the `(DFHack)` label, I think removing that part would only lead to more confusion - it's not taking up a lot of space. Also, red vs. green might not be obvious for anyone color-blind.\n\n@quietust might have more input, as he's the original author of manipulator.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1534189135,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE3ODYyMjE1NjA="},"added":["manipulator"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"a0e308df600b8063e6081e0d4e79d7398f8d57ea"},"timestamp":1534218081,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjc0NTAyMw==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1389#issuecomment-412745023"},"message":"Alright!
