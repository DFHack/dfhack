(small research binge)  Looks like the only viable options are [luadoc](https://github.com/keplerproject/luadoc) (deprecated), or [LDoc](https://github.com/stevedonovan/LDoc) (successor project).  Generated markdown from the latter _should_ work with our Sphinx-doc system, though it would be nice to make it generate proper `.rst` files.\n\nProbably best to write docs in the existing style ASAP, and someone can convert them over once there's a working system.","files":null}]}
