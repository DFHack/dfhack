I'm not opposed to moving the scripts directory to a submodule itself, but it's worth pointing out that cloning it into a DFHack installation could cause problems if CMake is pointed to the same installation. I'd prefer to make the script search path settings more user/dev-friendly - they make it really easy to develop personal scripts in a separate folder, as well as switching between personal and DFHack versions of scripts.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"f7b5a7930d0e1264ae1e4a774b03a7e78c2b7858"},"timestamp":1446508367,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzE5NjA3MQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/723#issuecomment-153196071"},"message":"Most people using this probably won't even have CMake installed, so I'm not sure that's important (beyond documenting that ofc).
