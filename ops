You need `inline constexpr` for that, but it is a C++17 feature (so I guess not acceptable here).\n\nUsing linux32 debug build:\n\n    ./libs/Dwarf_Fortress: symbol lookup error: ./hack/libdfhack-debug.so: undefined symbol: _ZN9MapExtras9BiomeInfo10MAX_LAYERSE\n\nWhy was the definition inside a ifdef block?
