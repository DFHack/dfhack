Maybe there an issue with project visibility or approach-ability?\n\nImho we need:\n\n- more tutorials. Most action happens in far raw modding. I think lua is way easier and powerful\n- more examples of use. A lot of dfhack is unknown for users (esp. when they get it from a pack).\n- more \"this is new\". There are changelogs but i'm not sure if anyone reads them.\n\nAm totally wrong on this?","files":null}]}
