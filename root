The result is working on v0.43.05 64-bit, except for ruby which can't be loaded. Symlinking libruby.so to the system .so causes ruby scripts to hang.\n\n```\n$ uname -a\nLinux LAPTOP01 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.16.7-ckt25-2+deb8u3 (2016-07-02) x86_64 GNU/Linux\n```\n\nChecklist (-@lethosor):\n- [x] Windows\n- [x] OS X\n- [x] Linux: #989","files":null}]}
