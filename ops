See for example [this post](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=139553.msg6728637#msg6728637) in the Bay12 thread.\n\nSpecifically, we should provide:\n- [x] an introduction for developers, covering in general terms the utility functions available, how to interact with data structures, how to tell if a tool should be a plugin or a script (and about the example scripts/ skeleton plugin), etc.  Probably split into tips for script authors, and tips for general DFHack developers.\n- [x] detailed information on usable DFHack functions, especially those exposed to scripts (ie ensure `Lua API.rst` is complete and up-to-date; corresponding docs for Ruby and C++ ?)\n- ~~API reference for DF data structures; basically a more readable, annotated and linked form of the XML files~~  Too much text, not enough commentary.  Just reading the xml directly is easier!\n- [x] do another pass for formatting, especially where keybinding styles would be appropriate.  Use search for ctrl/alt/shift/esc etc.\n\nI'll add a Travis test for docs building correctly too, and check that plugins are documented.","files":null}]}
