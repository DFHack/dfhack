There are no error notifications in the error log. (or is there a separate dfhack log? if so, please let me know!)\n\nAfter some trial and error, I found this is related to the twbt unit transparency (in one of the OnLoad init files). The above error only occurs when it is set to 1. If set to 0, the embark works fine. Right after that I can save, restart the game with twbt unit_transparency 1 and the map loads without problem. So this only occurs on the embark itself.","files":null}]}
