Encourage devs to use it for debugging. It's probably impossible to rule out all possiblilities for failure, but getting a bit closer can't hurt.\nUsing the 'debug' mode will obviously lead to some substantial performance hit. The user should be notified when he uses such a 'debug' mode SHM library.","files":null}]}
