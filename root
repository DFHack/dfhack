I don't know what key I pressed to get this error, which makes tracking it down much harder. I'm using the default DFHack configuration, so I didn't even explicitly enable \"this\" script. A quick grep says that there are 22 files containing `this script` and `qerror` on the same line, so there are a number of error messages that should be fixed.","files":null}]}
