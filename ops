You can see this if you run the workflow command in the dfhack window. Your constraint will be listed but then it will say \"No jobs\" This means that workflow doesn't think the job you were working with produces the specified item. I think for powders you can fix this by changing the item material for the job to the specific material (alt-a by default)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"a411bd8006c5edb71361568535f4c8bf3876c459"},"timestamp":1415293449,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDEzMzAw","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/367#issuecomment-62013300"},"message":"You mean by that that you can't limit a job by an item it doesn't produce directly(and unambiguously)? Like, I couldn't base my production of buckets on the amount of eggs I have, or for more serious example, I can't say \"make blocks till there are X-Y microcline blocks\"? Because that's what is happening now. If I choose blocks, and material microcline in advanced settings for limits, the limit does not appear on the right side, but it does appear in the \"Status\" list that contains all limits.\n\nBut it looks like the \"alt+a\" screen indeed solves that. Could I suggest adding a hint about it when in workshop? I would never guess there is something like that, and for some things (like Planning mode when \"b\"uilding) there are hints in interface.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1415307413,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDQ5ODU3","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/367#issuecomment-62049857"},"message":"Is this related to #366?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"a411bd8006c5edb71361568535f4c8bf3876c459"},"timestamp":1415308163,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDUxNjAw","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/367#issuecomment-62051600"},"message":"@lethosor No, it isn't. The other issue concerns a limit that appears on the right side of the screen, but shows there is 0 items even if there are some in stock.
