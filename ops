I made the same mistake.\n\nAfter switching to the `develop` branch (`git checkout develop`), I think you need to update the submodules again for this new branch. I ran `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` and noticed the a couple submodules, including \"xml\" updated.\n\nOptionally you might want to run `git clean -f -x` after the checkout command. I don't think you need to, but I found it helped.\n\nA reset and re-setup that worked for me:\n\n```\ngit reset --hard develop\ngit clean -f -x\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule update\n```\n\nMake sure you run those command in the \"dfhack\" directory (or whatever you cloned to). WARNING: `git clean` will remove any changed _you_ made to the files.\n\nNote, if you get a hash error for msvcrtruby187, download the file and copy it to `build\\VC2010\\plugins\\ruby`. The file is trying to be downloaded from \"[http://cloud.github.com/downloads/jjyg/dfhack/libruby187.tar.gz]\".\n\nHope this helps.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1407184907,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTE0NTU1","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/272#issuecomment-51114555"},"message":"For this, only `git submodule update` should be necessary, assuming you have a working clone (which it appears that you do).","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"9fc41122bcb62c46a9a37ab77c5d16581f199320"},"timestamp":1407186823,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTE4NTE3","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/272#issuecomment-51118517"},"message":"Ah, thank you.
