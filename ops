The search only checks if it matches straight from the beginning instead of looking for a partial match. E.g. you have one stockpile profile named \"food (no fat)\" and if I were to type \"no fat\" in the search, it doesn't show up; however if I were to type \"food\" then it shows up. In my opinion typing \"no fat\" should make that profile show.","files":null}]}
