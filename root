Loading from command line behaves correctly.\n\nThis bugs are only reproducible on OSX, linux and windows not affected. Tested: 10.7.5 and 10.9.3.\n\nThere is ample error handling and directory detection. On windows and linux a helpful error message is displayed in a message box, but on OSX it just crashes. I don't have a Mac so I can't figure out exactly where its crashing.","files":null}]}
