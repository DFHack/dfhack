The main use case for me is trying to pull wooden barrels out of circulation without manually finding \u0026 dumping them. Currently, I use a sockpile/minecart to dump the barrels in to a locked pit so they are inaccessible.  This could also be useful if you wanted to build materials for use later (magma pump stack) and wanted to keep them out of circulation.","files":null}]}
