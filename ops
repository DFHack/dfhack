Note that most `alias` commands I've encountered take the alias name first (e.g. bash's built-in `alias` command).\n70 scripts don't make up even half of the output of `ls`, though, so I have mixed feelings about moving a lot of scripts to subdirectories. I feel like this would be more useful for things like your `repeatMonthly` example - if a lot of scripts are moved to subdirectories, it would be simpler to add those directories to the script search path than adding aliases for all of them in dfhack.init.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"c1566abe3d2bcce0ca1ce2256f1162ee88285b53"},"timestamp":1443323833,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzUxNDkxNA==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/701#issuecomment-143514914"},"message":"Nothing to add beyond it being a great idea, and useful forward compatibility step as well I would think.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"f7b5a7930d0e1264ae1e4a774b03a7e78c2b7858"},"timestamp":1443329489,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzUxODcxMQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/701#issuecomment-143518711"},"message":"There are a couple of general categories of tools:\n- Persistent (eg many fix scripts) - generally invoked from an init automatically\n- GUI (etc) - mostly kebound\n- Modding tools - invoked from raws\n- Interactive, eg the `liquids` plugin.  Alias could shorten the invocation, especially if in a folder\n- One-use tools and commands, eg `dig*`, `clean *`, etc.\n\nIt's the last category that this is a big win for - especially because different people have favourite commands and flags for them.
