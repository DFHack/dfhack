In this case the functions would not get recognized after unloading, replacing and loading the plugin (lua error message that the field is nil, field name being the name of the new function). It was necessary to exit and restart the game. I don't have enough insight on what is causing this and how (if it's possible at all) to fix this and didn't investigate further, so I'll just leave this here.","files":null}]}
