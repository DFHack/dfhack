So certain highly skilled dwarves can be kept right where I want them.\n\nAnd on the flip side, I think the opposite would be beneficial as well. Set a certain custom profession to be the only profession that labor manager will work with.\n\nAnd I believe this functionality could settle in nicely to allow the tool to play nice with Dwarf Therapist, which allows a fine degree of control of dwarf labors. However the downside of Dwarf Therapist is it requires a lot of micro-management at times.\n\nIf this this feature were added to Labor Manager, this would allow a person to use Dwarf Therapist to only handle exactly what they want while letting Labor Manager deal with every other labor.\n\nThis could honestly be expanded a bit more to include part of auto hauler in it as well. Where Labor Manager will ignore the dwarf accept when idle, where it will only provide them with hauling jobs that need doing.\n\n\nI'm considering taking a stab at either adding this feature to Labor Manager, or making a new plugin that pulls from Labor Manager with some adjustments. But would like opinions from those who have worked on the project longer before diving in.","files":null}]}
