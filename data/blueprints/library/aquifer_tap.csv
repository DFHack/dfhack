"This blueprint will help you get a safe, everlasting source of fresh water from a light aquifer."
""
Here's the procedure:
""
1) Dig a tunnel from where you want the water to end up (e.g. your well cistern) off to an unused portion of the map. Be sure to dig a one-tile-wide diagonal segment in this tunnel so water that will eventually flow through the tunnel is depressurized.
""
"2) From the end of that tunnel, dig a staircase straight up to the z-level just below the lowest aquifer level. Also dig the staircase down one z-level below the tunnel level."
""
"3) From the bottom of the staircase (the z-level below where the water will flow to your cisterns), dig a straight, one-tile wide tunnel to the edge of the map. This is your drainage tunnel. Smooth the map edge tile and carve a fortification. The water can flow through the fortification and off the map, allowing the dwarves to dig out the aquifer tap without drowning."
""
4) Place a lever-controlled floodgate in the drainage tunnel and open the floodgate. Place the lever somewhere else in your fort so that it will remain dry and accessible.
""
"5) If you care about how nice things look, haul away any boulders in the tunnels and smooth the tiles. You won't be able to access any of this area once it fills up with water!"
""
"6) Apply this blueprint (gui/quickfort library/aquifer_tap.csv -n /dig) to the z-level above the top of the staircase, inside the lowest aquifer level. Do not unpause until after the next step."
""
"7) Damp tiles cancel dig designations if the tile is currently hidden, so to avoid having to re-apply this blueprint after every tile your dwarves dig, position the cursor straight up (north) of the left-most tile designated for digging and straight left (west) of the topmost designated tile and run the following commands in the DFHack console:"
tiletypes-command f any ; f designated 1 ; p any ; p hidden 0 ; r 23 23 1
tiletypes-here
""
"8) Unpause and dig out the tap. If you care about appearances, haul away any boulders and feel free to remove the ramps (d-z). The water will safely flow down the staircase, through the open floodgate, down the drainage tunnel, and off the map until you choose to close the floodgate."

"9) Once everything is dug out and all dwarves are out of the waterways, close the floodgate. Your cisterns will fill with water. Since the waterway to your cisterns is depressurized, the cisterns will stay forever full, but will not flood."
""
A diagram might be useful. Here is a vertical view through the z-levels. This blueprint goes at the top:
""
j  <- center of this blueprint
i
... <- make this as tall as you need
i
i <- cistern outlet level
u <- drainage level
""
"Good luck! If done right, this method is the safest way to supply your fort with clean water."
