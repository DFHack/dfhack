It's not currently an issue but it may later be a problem. The most correct way to do it is to have CMake keep a list of the files installed in the last successful install and delete those before starting a new install (but ideally after confirming that the program builds). I'm pretty sure there are standard solutions to this for CMake but I don't know them.\n\nThis is a persnickety issue: it's technically wrong but there are no current important effects.","files":null}]}
