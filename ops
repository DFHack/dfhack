We could add a module(?) that would allow easy screenshot of part or all of screen. Maybe integrate with [map render plugin](https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/blob/develop/plugins/map-render.cpp) that way you could screenshot offscreen things without (not sure if it helps??) too much hacking.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1602389641,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM4NjMzMjQ1NjY="},"added":["idea"],"removed":[]}]}
