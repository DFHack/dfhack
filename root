The nice announcement helps me at least expel them manually, which is nice. I was thinking, maybe emigration should use the new expel feature, instead of whatever it's doing now? The only issue is that it doesn't work on units with family that permanently live off-site (acknowledged bug, [http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=10848](url)\n\nThanks for the DFhack!","files":null}]}
