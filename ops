This is an issue for non-release-specific updates, like #944 - after that was fixed, it took almost a month for the change to be merged into master and take effect, during which time we were still without a banner.\n\nI guess one possibility would be to make all updates to develop (still) and cherry-pick necessary ones onto the master branch. This may run into issues with merge conflicts, though - _someone_ made a commit to Contributing.rst on master once, and then cherry-picked it onto develop, and the merge conflict at release time needed to be manually resolved, even though I don't think there was any difference between the two versions of the file. (Also, I'm not sure if it would be possible to cherry-pick commits onto master, since we've set up Github to only allow commits that have passed CI to be pushed to master, and cherry-picked commits would have different IDs by default.)\n\nAnyway, thoughts? It helps that most of our documentation is on ReadTheDocs now, but there are still a few things that need to stay tracked and run into this issue occasionally.\n\nEdit: also #707, #708","files":null}]}
