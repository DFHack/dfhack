Make it vary the message size. Both message numbers and and amount of transferred data should be tracked.\n\nBasically:\n1. client memcpys a message to the buffer\n2. server memcpys it out and back in.\n3. client reads the message and verifies that it's the same as the one sent in the first step\n4. repeat to filter out noise.\n\nThen we can determine the impact of other running processes, compare single core vs. multi core, etc.","files":null}]}
