OK\nLoaded 3 DF symbol tables.\n\nDF will then crash. Aside from DFHack's extraction, the only modifications made to DF were a tileset and colour scheme.\n\nEDIT: I think I can safely assume that this is due to trying to run DFHack v.0.4.19 with DF v.0.4.23. Apologies for time-wasting.\n\nEDIT 2: Screen capture here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/vt8aphm8yjnhexf/Record_02.avi\n\nEDIT 3: I have tested a clean install of DF, as well as after the modifications before the DFHack install - both run.","files":null}]}
