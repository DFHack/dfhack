# Directory tree to search for blueprints. Can be set to an absolute or relative
# path. If set to a relative path, resolves to a directory under the DF folder.
# Note that if you change this directory, you will not automatically pick up
# blueprints written by the DFHack "blueprint" plugin (which always writes to
# the "blueprints" dir).

# mode. If false, only cells with dig codes explicitly prefixed with an "m" will

# Skip query blueprint sanity checks that detect common blueprint errors and
# halt or skip keycode playback. Checks include ensuring a configurable building
# exists at the designated cursor position and verifying the active UI screen is
# the same before and after sending keys for the cursor position. If you find
# you need to enable this for one of your own blueprints, you should probably be
# using a config blueprint, not a query blueprint.

# Set to the maximum number of resources you want assigned to stockpiles of the
# relevant types. Set to -1 for DF defaults (number of stockpile tiles for
# stockpiles that take barrels and bins, 1 wheelbarrow for stone stockpiles).
# The default here for wheelbarrows is 0 since using wheelbarrows normally
# *decreases* the efficiency of your fort.
