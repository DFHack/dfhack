Using dwarfvet report confirms that the hospital is the zone I have designated as Hospital+Animal Training and it is in the correct location. The animals that it identifies as patients can all walk and can access the hospital. Additionally when I get one of those patients in the hospital (pasturing then removing the pasture so it doesn't interfere), they still spam rest area inaccessible.","files":null}]}
