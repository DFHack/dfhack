liquids
=======
Allows adding magma, water and obsidian to the game. It replaces the normal
dfhack command line and can't be used from a hotkey. Settings will be remembered
as long as dfhack runs. Intended for use in combination with the command
``liquids-here`` (which can be bound to a hotkey).  See also :issue:`80`.

.. warning::

    Spawning and deleting liquids can mess up pathing data and
    temperatures (creating heat traps). You've been warned.

.. note::

    `gui/liquids` is an in-game UI for this script.

Settings will be remembered until you quit DF. You can call `liquids-here` to execute
the last configured action, which is useful in combination with keybindings.

Usage: point the DF cursor at a tile you want to modify and use the commands.

If you only want to add or remove water or magma from one tile,
`source` may be easier to use.
