Currently, every time I start up the game, I have to reselect the materials for whatever kind of construction I'm building. It would be nice if I could automatically set all materials for all constructions via a command like `automaterial -shape ALL -item BLOCKS -material DIORITE JET MICA SLATE GABBRO`. This way, even if I don't have a certain material, it can be marked as automatic for when I do get it.\nThanks for all the hard work, I'm loving dfhack!","files":null}]}
