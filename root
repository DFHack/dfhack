I don't know how to generate stack dumps or anything fancy like that for DF, but if you can point me at some instructions I'll be happy to do what I can.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Embark anywhere\n2. Build any workshop (e.g., mason's workshop)\n3. Create a job (e.g., build rock door), set it to repeat\n4. Run 'workflow count DOOR 30', observe that the job is registered to workflow (e.g., look for 'job 687: ConstructDoor [rock]' in workflow output)\n5. Deconstruct mason's workshop\n6.
