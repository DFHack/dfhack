This plugin provides a collection of OpenGL lighting filters that affect how the
map is drawn to the screen.

Usage
-----

``rendermax light``
    Light the map tiles realistically. Outside tiles are light during the day
    and dark at night. Inside tiles are always dark unless a nearby unit is
    lighting it up, as if they were carrying torches.
``rendermax light sun <hour>|cycle``
    Set the outside lighting to correspond with the specified day hour (1-24),
    or specify ``cycle`` to have the lighting follow the sun (which is the
    default).
``rendermax light reload``
    Reload the lighting settings file.
``rendermax trippy``
    Randomize the color of each tile. Used for fun, or testing.
``rendermax disable``
    Disable any ``rendermax`` lighting filters that are currently active.

For better visibility, try changing the black color in palette to non totally
black. See :forums:`128487` for more info.
