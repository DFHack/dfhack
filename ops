I propose:\n\n1) do nothing until quickfort has been \"proven\" for at least one release and no significant bugs are open against it\n2) advertise that fortplan and digfort are deprecated:\n- output a deprecation warning when they are run, pointing people to quickfort\n- update their documentation with the deprecation warning and pointer to quickfort\n- add a deprecation warning and pointer to quickfort to their source files\n3) after a good amount of time (one year?), remove fortplan and digfort source but leave documentation stubs that announce what has happened and provide a pointer to quickfort\n4) after more time (or maybe never), remove the documentation stubs for fortplan and digfort","files":null}]}
