It would be good to either port and update the valuable features, or decide it's not worth it and delete them.\n- `hotkey-notes.lua` - an in-progress port of `hotkeynotedump.py`;  I just don't know how to get the name and jump coords of each hotkey...  help or pointers to documentation would be appreciated.\n- `copypaste.cpp` is a high value target - a proof of concept plugin to allow copy-pasting in DF.  It does both terrain and buildings and constructions!  This would probably be tricky, but worth it.  Maybe the port could simply output a quickfort blueprint set for the specified volume?\n- `creaturemanager.cpp` - modify skills and labors of creatures, kill creatures, et.  It's impressive but I suspect most functions are implemented elsewhere (eg `manipulator`).  Obsolete and deletable?  Or worth updating?\n\nDiscussion would be good, or if someone wanted to re-implement those plugins which deserve it that would be even better!","files":null}]}
