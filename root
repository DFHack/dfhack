Having them all available through GitHub would be nice, and minimize the difficulty of finding any particular release.  With the tags already in place, it should be more tedious than difficult!\n\nAt the same time, adding the relevant NEWS or changelog to these old releases would give a better sense of history.  The formatting of this part of the releases page could be made more consistent, too.\n\nObviously this isn't at all urgent, but once DF updates, pulls, issues, and so on are under control it's something to consider.","files":null}]}
