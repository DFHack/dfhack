  Autolabor plugin:
    - can set nonidle hauler percentage.
    - broker excluded from all labors when needed at depot.
    - likewise, anybody with a scheduled diplomat meeting.
  New Dwarf Manipulator plugin:
    Open the unit list, and press 'l' to access a Dwarf Therapist like UI in the game.
  New Steam Engine plugin:
    Dwarven Water Reactors don't make any sense whatsoever and cause lag, so this may be
    a replacement for those concerned by it. The plugin detects if a workshop with a
    certain name is in the raws used by the current world, and provides the necessary
    behavior. See hack/raw/*_steam_engine.txt for the necessary raw definitions.
    Note: Stuff like animal treadmills might be more period, but absolutely can't be
    done with tools dfhack has access to.
  New Power Meter plugin:
    When activated, implements a pressure plate modification that detects power in gear
    boxes built on the four adjacent N/S/W/E tiles. The gui/power-meter script implements
    the necessary build configuration UI.
  New Siege Engine plugin:
    When enabled and configured via gui/siege-engine, allows aiming siege engines
    at a designated rectangular area with 360 degree fire range and across Z levels;
    this works by rewriting the projectile trajectory immediately after it appears.
    Also supports loading catapults with non-boulder projectiles, taking from a stockpile,
    and restricting operator skill range like with ordinary workshops.
    Disclaimer: not in any way to undermine the future siege update from Toady, but
    the aiming logic of existing engines hasn't been updated since 2D, and is almost
    useless above ground :(. Again, things like making siegers bring their own engines
    is totally out of the scope of dfhack and can only be done by Toady.
  New Add Spatter plugin:
    Detects reactions with certain names in the raws, and changes them from adding
    improvements to adding item contaminants. This allows directly covering items
    with poisons. The added spatters are immune both to water and 'clean items'.
    Intended to give some use to all those giant cave spider poison barrels brought
    by the caravans.
