When removing it, they are shown correctly. The floor tiles don't cause any difference. Is there a workaround for it?\n\n2) Stonesense is crashing as soon as 29 floor layers are shown at the same time. 28 Floor layers work fine. It doesn't matter how many tiles are indicated. 29 layers of plain sky crash too. Are there any known issues? It is also worth noting, that the crash causes also a crash of Dwarf Fortress.","files":null}]}
