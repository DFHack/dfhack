Can that total be displayed even while grouped (at the bottom)?  Useful for dyes and bones, too.  Maybe other things?\n\nThe manager search, and maybe the plugin search too (can't remember), lets me type words out of order and only prefixes/parts of individual words.  So \"BI BRO BRE FO\", in any order, matches \"forge bismuth bronze breastplate\".  Handy in particular for managing normal-size and giant-size silks; \"giant thread\" or \"giant silk\" is usually unambiguous enough.  Full-on regexes would be cooler...\n\nThe normal stocks and trading screens let me apply filters like \"instruments\", \"crafts\", and \"food\".  That would be useful for trying to manipulate instruments and their pieces separately.  (So I can search for lunrud and filter by \"tools\" in order to get only lunrud pieces.)","files":null}]}
