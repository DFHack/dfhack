It currently reads: `Manage labors (DFHack)`. I propose that we shorten that to `Manage labors`.\n\nMotivation:\n* Breaks immersion. _(This is the main reason I bring it up for discussion.)_\n* Adds visual noise.\n* Other plugins do not label their added options with `DFHack`.\n* Options added by DFHack plugins are traditionally marked with red hot key reminders, as opposed to the usual green of vanilla DF, so there is no need for an extra label.\n\nIf there is consensus, I can make the _(trivial)_ pull request.","files":null}]}
