Also colorize them differently, it would be nice to also have simple diff (e.g. timestamp/filesize?) to see what changed.

I think that would be enough information - there's not really any room for timestamps or diffs, so those could be a separate command.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1486350772,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTQ5Njg4MjIy"},"status":2}]}
