embark-assistant
================

This plugin provides embark site selection help. It has to be run with the
``embark-assistant`` command while the pre-embark screen is displayed and shows
extended (and correct(?)) resource information for the embark rectangle as well
as normally undisplayed sites in the current embark region. It also has a site
selection tool with more options than DF's vanilla search tool. For detailed
help invoke the in game info screen.
