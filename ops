Embark the dwarves straight away\n- When the \"real\" game starts, go to the DFHack terminal and type \"stonesense\"\n- The stonesense window briefly appears and starts loading resources (sprites or whatnot). It shows a text message in a sprite font telling you what it's currently loading\n\n**Expected behaviour :** Stonesense finishes loading\n**Observed (faulty behaviour) :** The Stonesense window closes almost immediately before you have time to read what's on screen. The DF and DHHack windows instantly crash and close too.\n\n**Troubleshooting :** \n\nLast lines of gamelog.txt : \n\u003e Loaded region1, Thur Num (The Universes of Wind) at coordinates (9,8)\nLoaded the fortress Ritas‹ngiz (Owlceilings), colonized by the group F“kerfath (The Slippery Sacks) of the civilization Tulon Atham (The Roads of Focus).\n\nLast lines of stderr.txt : \n\u003e dfhack: redirecting stderr to stderr.log (again)\n\nLast lines of stderr.log : \n\n\u003e Invoking: stonesense\nlibpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile\nlibpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile\nlibpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile\nlibpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile\nlibpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile\nlibpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile\nlibpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile\nlibpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile\nlibpng warning: iCCP: out-of-date sRGB profile with no signature\nClient connection established.\nShutting down client connection.","files":null}]}
