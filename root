I can't get it to reactivate*, either. Tested by using an onSyndrome function that simply prints that there was a function that activated; despite continually using a self-targeting interaction that applied a syndrome that definitely worked (it gives a display name), the function never activated.\n\n*using enableEvent, which probably wouldn't work in any case but hey, I was desperate.","files":null}]}
