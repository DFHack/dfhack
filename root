Ideally we could parse them and translate to a nicely cross-linked format, but full support for that is more trouble than it's worth at this stage.\n\n[Here's an example implementation](https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/compare/develop...PeridexisErrant:xml-docs); I'll make a pull request once I do some more work (switch to stdlib XML library, and confirm Py2 support) and #972 is merged (so I can improve style without merge conflicts).\n\nThis demo version has a page per file, broken into sections with link targets (for use by eg. the Lua API docs).  Each section is just pretty-printed and syntax-highlighted xml however, and I'm not planning to do more than that - improving the comments in the source files would be far more useful.","files":null}]}
