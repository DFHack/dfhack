There are countless terminal emulators on Linux and macOS, and there's no way to support all of them. If you close your terminal window, it might work, but there's also a possibility that it will kill DF or cause DFHack to get stuck in a loop trying to read from the console.\n\nYou could experiment with setting the DFHACK_DISABLE_CONSOLE environment variable. However, the terminal window is typically opened by your OS, so there's not an easy way for DFHack to avoid opening it entirely.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1511812916,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzMwOTI1MQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1169#issuecomment-347309251"},"message":"Besides DFHACK_DISABLE_CONSOLE, I don't think there's a way we can support this.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1511812916,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTM2MDAxOTE1Mg=="},"status":2},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1511812921,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEzNjAwMTkzMzM="},"added":["idea"],"removed":[]}]}
