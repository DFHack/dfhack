Note that none of that accounts for babies, which I have no idea how the game keeps track of babies being held (some sort of general ref?)\n\u003e \n\u003e babies are counted as riding the mothers, I believe.\n\nThis is probably fixable by checking for creatures riding a teleporting unit, and if found teleporting them to the same location (and ensuring they're still riding).","files":null}]}
