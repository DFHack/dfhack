Perhaps by adding a tar \u0026 upload command to the end of the existing build script, uploading to Github releases.\n\nOr, potentially much better, there's this:  [Nightli.es: \"provides automatic nightly builds for Travis CI.\"](https://nightli.es/)\n\nFor Windows and OSX: I run both concurrently and my PC is on 24/7, so I'd be happy to have a script running in the background of both OS' that checks Travis for successful builds and git pulls, builds and uploads the resulting file. \n\nWe could make the script to do that available in the repo and potentially multiple contributors could add it on a schedule, to share the load/add redundancy - with some kind of checking in the script so the release is only built once.\n\nAnd/or maybe some DFHack contributors have access to proper Windows and/or OSX servers that could run such a script - perhaps a work server they administer (and are allowed some freedom on.)\n\nThoughts?","files":null}]}
