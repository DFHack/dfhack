My request is that the dwarf's nickname be checked for a special character then exclude the dwarf from labor changes it present. \n\nif \"*\" in dwarf_nickname:\n    Do not change any labours\n\nIf possible the dwarfs should still be tallied for for the purposes of labour assignments e.g if the target is to have 5 miners and the excluded dwarf has mining enabled only 4 more dwarfs needs mining enabled.","files":null}]}
