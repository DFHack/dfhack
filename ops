It can dramatically increase performance if you have any compute-bound lua code. Also, it's api-compatible with standard lua, has a tiny footprint, and is mit-licensed.\nI don't know dfhack very well, so I'm not sure how much it would help, but it could be a nice speed bonus for a relatively simple swap-in.","files":null}]}
