One I specifically want used for gem cutting, and the other I want used for gem setting. If you have a manager, you can set the type of job each workshop is used for in the workshop profile. Specifically, I can disable gem cutting for one workshop, and disable gem setting for the other workshop. Even doing this though, autogems will still send cut gem jobs to both workshops. It would be nice if autogems respected this setting, or if there were another way to tell it to only send jobs to specific workshops.","files":null}]}
