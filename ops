(I need a savegame with a tree diplomacy agreement currently in force in order to investigate this.)\n\nNote, however, that autochop currently simply marks all eligible trees for chopping and then unmarks them when the threshold is exceeded. It would be better if autochop would instead only mark the largest eligible trees, up to the lesser of the limit allowed by the agreement or the number required to reach its cutoff threshold, but this is a significantly more difficult strategy to implement.","files":null}]}
