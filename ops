From http://dfhack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/_auto/modtools.html:\n\n\u003e `modtools/*` scripts provide tools for modders, often with changes to the raw files, and are not intended to be called manually by end-users.\n\nOnce it supports supports creating items in buildings/containers, and other features of createitem, I would be okay with making a createitem script that wraps the modtools one, but I don't see any clear advantages of doing that that outweigh the advantages of a plugin known to be stable.\n\n`gui/hack-wish` was intended for users used to the old name. I'm not sure what the advantage of removing it would be, really, since we don't need the name for something else and the alias isn't requiring any effort to maintain.\n\nI'm not too familiar with the other two, but they sound okay to remove to me (once forceequip is checked, etc.).","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1481301408,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDg4ODU4NzI1OQ=="},"added":["idea"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"be523fe0f95fc478bda36c722e6f106f8f7a41b5"},"timestamp":1498598848,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTQ5MTA0MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1012#issuecomment-311491040"},"message":"To be honest I think nobody even used `reaction-trigger-transition` back when it was relevant. It's fine to remove it.\n\nThe (slight) benefit of removing `gui/hack-wish` would be to unclutter the output of `ls`. We could maintain backwards compatibility with #701 (alias command).\n\nI agree `modtools/create-item` should be able to make left and right gloves with one call and then `createitem` should be removed.\n\nTechnically I wrote `modtools/equip-item` not remembering that `equipitem` existed, but it does seem to do the same thing.

It's simpler and more concise, supports creating items in containers and buildings, and has a lot of documentation already (including on the DF wiki). I'd be okay with replacing `createitem` with a wrapper script, as long as it keeps the same syntax and features, but \"modtools\" scripts are scripts that *only modders* should use (i.e. if a user has to type \"modtools/\" in the console to run a command, and they're not testing stuff for modding purposes, then that script is in the wrong place).","files":null}]}
