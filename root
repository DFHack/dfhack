When I run the command \"startdwarf\" I get the following\n\n`E: RuntimeError: ./hack/scripts/startdwarf.rb:18: patch address not available\n ./hack/scripts/startdwarf.rb:18\n (eval):1:in \"load\"\n (eval):1\n (eval):1:in \"catch\"\n (eval):1'`\n\nI'm no expert, but this seems to be due to the fact that start_dwarf_count is missing a value in the linux section of symbols.xml.\n\nIs there any way to determine this value so I can manually fix the problem with symbols.xml?","files":null}]}
