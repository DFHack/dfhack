A corner should work most times).","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1479217868,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDY0NjA0Nw==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1014#issuecomment-260646047"},"message":"Yeah, so the issue is that getplants hasn't been updated to handle multi-tile trees, like Quietust said.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1493052785,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5Njc0MTE2OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1015#issuecomment-296741169"},"message":"I haven't been able to reproduce this in 0.43.05-beta2 on x64 with those 3 scripts enabled.
