===[[[
The text below is included in docs/dev/Documentation.rst - see that file for more details on the changelog setup.
This is kept in this file as a quick syntax reference.

===help

changelog.txt uses a syntax similar to RST, with a few special sequences:

- ``===`` indicates the start of a comment
- ``#`` indicates the start of a release name (do not include "DFHack")
- ``##`` indicates the start of a section name (this must be listed in ``gen_changelog.py``)
- ``-`` indicates the start of a changelog entry. **Note:** an entry currently must be only one line.
- ``:`` (colon followed by space) separates the name of a feature from a description of a change to that feature.
    Changes made to the same feature are grouped if they end up in the same section.
- ``:\`` (colon, backslash, space) avoids the above behavior
- ``- @`` (the space is optional) indicates the start of an entry that should only be displayed in NEWS-dev.rst.
    Use this sparingly, e.g. for immediate fixes to one development build in another development build that
    are not of interest to users of stable builds only.
- Three ``[`` characters indicate the start of a block (possibly a comment) that
  spans multiple lines. Three ``]`` characters indicate the end of such a block.
- ``!`` immediately before a phrase set up to be replaced (see gen_changelog.py) stops that occurrence from being replaced.

- `autolabor`: work detail override warning now only appears on the work details screen
- `RemoteFortressReader`: ensured names are transmitted in UTF-8 instead of CP437

## Misc Improvements
- `autodump`: no longer checks for a keyboard cursor before executing, so ``autodump destroy`` (which doesn't require a cursor) can still function
- Settings: recover gracefully when settings files become corrupted (e.g. by DF CTD)
- `orders`: update orders in library for prepared meals, bins, archer uniforms, and weapons
- `gui/control-panel`: new preference for whether filters in lists search for substrings in the middle of words (e.g. if set to true, then "ee" will match "steel")
- `gui/design`: Improved performance for drawing shapes
- Dreamfort: improve traffic patterns throughout the fortress
- `gui/blueprint`: recording of stockpile layouts and categories is now supported. note that detailed stockpile configurations will *not* be saved (yet)

- `overlay`: add links to the quickstart guide and the control panel on the DF title screen
- Window behavior: non-resizable windows now allow dragging by their frame edges by default
- `gui/autodump`: fort-mode keybinding: Ctrl-H (when ``armok`` tools are enabled in `gui/control-panel`)

- `stockpiles`: allow filtering creatures by tameability

## Internals
- ``dfhack.internal``: added memory analysis functions: ``msizeAddress``, ``getHeapState``, ``heapTakeSnapshot``, ``isAddressInHeap``, ``isAddressActiveInHeap``, ``isAddressUsedAfterFreeInHeap``, ``getAddressSizeInHeap``, and ``getRootAddressOfHeapObject``

## Lua
- ``overlay.reload()``: has been renamed to ``overlay.rescan()`` so as not to conflict with the global ``reload()`` function. If you are developing an overlay, please take note of the new function name for reloading your overlay during development.
- ``gui``: changed frame naming scheme to ``FRAME_X`` rather than ``X_FRAME``, and added aliases for backwards compatibility. (for example ``BOLD_FRAME`` is now called ``FRAME_BOLD``)
- ``ensure_keys``: walks a series of keys, creating new tables for any missing values

## Removed
- `orders`: ``library/military_include_artifact_materials`` library file removed since recent research indicates that platinum blunt weapons and silver crossbows are not more effective than standard steel. the alternate military orders file was also causing unneeded confusion.

- `gui/control-panel`: add preference option for hiding "armok" tools in command lists
- ``Dwarf Therapist``: add a warning to the Labors screen when Dwarf Therapist is active so players know that changes they make to that screen will have no effect. If you're starting a new embark and nobody seems to be doing anything, check your Labors tab for this warning to see if Dwarf Therapist thinks it is in control (even if it's not running).
- `overlay`: add the DFHack version string to the DF title screen

## Lua

- `buildingplan`: can now filter by cloth and silk materials (for ropes)
-@ `buildingplan`: rearranged elements of ``planneroverlay`` interface
-@ `buildingplan`: rearranged elements of ``itemselection`` interface

-@ Mods: scripts from only the most recent version of an installed mod are added to the script path
-@ Mods: give active mods a chance to reattach their load hooks when a world is reloaded
- `gui/control-panel`: bugfix services are now enabled by default
- Core: hide DFHack terminal console by default when running on Steam Deck

## Documentation

# 50.07-beta2

## New Plugins
- `getplants`: reinstated: designate trees for chopping and shrubs for gathering according to type

## Misc Improvements
- `buildingplan`: filters and global settings are now ignored when manually choosing items for a building, allowing you to make custom choices independently of the filters that would otherwise be used
- `buildingplan`: if `suspendmanager` is running, then planned buildings will be left suspended when their items are all attached. `suspendmanager` will unsuspend them for construction when it is safe to do so.
- `buildingplan`: add option for autoselecting the last manually chosen item (like `automaterial` used to do)
- `confirm`: adds confirmation for removing burrows via the repaint menu
- `stockpiles`: support applying stockpile configurations with fully enabled categories to stockpiles in worlds other than the one where the configuration was exported from

DFHack recognizes two directories in a mod's folder: ``scripts_modinstalled/`` and ``scripts_modactive/``. ``scripts_modinstalled/`` folders will always be added the script path, regardless of whether the mod is active in a world. ``scripts_modactive/`` folders will only be added to the script path when the mod is active in the current loaded world.

## Documentation
- `modding-guide`: guide updated to include information for 3rd party script developers
- the ``untested`` tag has been renamed to ``unavailable`` to better reflect the status of the remaining unavailable tools. most of the simply "untested" tools have now been tested and marked as working. the remaining tools are known to need development work before they are available again.

## Lua
- ``widgets.Label``: tokens can now specify a ``htile`` property to indicate the tile that should be shown when the Label is hovered over with the mouse
- ``widgets.Label``: click handlers no longer get the label itself as the first param to the click handler
- ``widgets.CycleHotkeyLabel``: options that are bare integers will no longer be interpreted as the pen color in addition to being the label and value
- ``widgets.CycleHotkeyLabel``: option labels and pens can now be functions that return a label or pen

# 50.07-beta1

## Fixes

-@ `buildingplan`: add ``buildingplan reset`` command for resetting all filters to defaults
-@ `buildingplan`: rename "Build" button to "Confirm" on the item selection dialog and change the hotkey from "B" to "C"
- `blueprint`: now writes blueprints to the ``dfhack-config/blueprints`` directory
- `blueprint-library-guide`: library blueprints have moved from ``blueprints`` to ``hack/data/blueprints``
- `blueprint-library-guide`: player-created blueprints should now go in the ``dfhack-config/blueprints`` folder. please move your existing blueprints from ``blueprints`` to ``dfhack-config/blueprints``. you don't need to move the library blueprints -- those can be safely deleted from the old ``blueprints`` directory.
-@ `showmood`: clarify how many bars and/or cloth items are actually needed for the mood

## Removed
-@ `buildingplan`: "heat safety" setting is temporarily removed while we investigate incorrect item matching

# 50.07-alpha3

## Fixes
-@ ``widgets.HotkeyLabel``: don't trigger on click if the widget is disabled
- ``dfhack.job.isSuitableMaterial``: now properly detects lack of fire and magma safety for vulnerable materials with high melting points

- `buildingplan`: entirely new UI for building placement, item selection, and materials filtering!

## API
- Gui focus strings will no longer get the "dfhack/" prefix if the string "dfhack/" already exists in the focus string
- ``Military``: New module for military functionality
- ``Military``: new ``makeSquad`` to create a squad
- ``Military``: changed ``getSquadName`` to take a squad identifier
- ``Military``: new ``updateRoomAssignments`` for assigning a squad to a barracks and archery range

## Removed
-@ ``gui.THIN_FRAME``: replaced by ``gui.INTERIOR_FRAME``
- `automaterial`: all functionality has been merged into `buildingplan`

# 50.07-alpha2

## Fixes
-@ `nestboxes`: fixed bug causing nestboxes themselves to be forbidden, which prevented citizens from using them to lay eggs. Now only eggs are forbidden.
-@ `autobutcher`: implemented work-around for Dwarf Fortress not setting nicknames properly, so that nicknames created in the in-game interface are detected & protect animals from being butchered properly. Note that nicknames for unnamed units are not currently saved by dwarf fortress - use ``enable fix/protect-nicks`` to fix any nicknames created/removed within dwarf fortress so they can be saved/reloaded when you reload the game.
-@ `seedwatch`: fix saving and loading of seed stock targets
- `autodump`: changed behaviour to only change ``dump`` and ``forbid`` flags if an item is successfully dumped.
-@ `autochop`: generate default names for burrows with no assigned names

-@ `channel-safely`: fix an out of bounds error regarding the REPORT event listener receiving (presumably) stale id's

## Misc Improvements
- `autobutcher`: logs activity to the console terminal instead of making disruptive in-game announcements
- DFHack tool windows that capture mouse clicks (and therefore prevent you from clicking on the "pause" button) now unconditionally pause the game when they open (but you can still unpause with the keyboard if you want to). Examples of this behavior: `gui/quickfort`, `gui/blueprint`, `gui/liquids`
- `showmood`: now shows the number of items needed for cloth and bars in addition to the technically correct but always confusing "total dimension" (150 per bar or 10,000 per cloth)
-@ Stopped mouse clicks from affecting the map when a click on a DFHack screen dismisses the window
- `confirm`: configuration data is now persisted globally.
- `tailor`: add support for adamantine cloth (off by default); improve logging

-@ `automelt`: is now more resistent to vanilla savegame corruption
-@ `hotkeys`: DFHack logo is now hidden on screens where it covers important information when in the default position (e.g. when choosing an embark site)
- `misery`: now persists state with the fort
-@ `autodump`: reinstate ``autodump-destroy-item``, hotkey: Ctrl-K
- `autodump`: new hotkey for ``autodump-destroy-here``: Ctrl-H
-@ `dig`: new hotkeys for vein designation on z-level (Ctrl-V) and vein designation across z-levels (Ctrl-Shift-V)
-@ `clean`: new hotkey for `spotclean`: Ctrl-C
- `autobutcher`: changed defaults from 5 females / 1 male to 4 females / 2 males so a single unfortunate accident doesn't leave players without a mating pair
- `autobutcher`: now immediately loads races available at game start into the watchlist

-@ `orders`: recipe for silver crossbows removed from ``library/military`` as it is not a vanilla recipe, but is available in ``library/military_include_artifact_materials``
- `stonesense`: added an ``INVERT_MOUSE_Z`` option to invert the mouse wheel direction

## Documentation

## API

- ``widgets.HotkeyLabel``: Added ``setLabel`` method to allow easily updating the label text without mangling the keyboard shortcut.
- ``widgets.HotkeyLabel``: Added ``setOnActivate`` method to allow easily updating the ``on_activate`` callback.

# 50.05-alpha3.1

## Fixes
-@ `seedwatch`: fix parameter parsing when setting targets

# 50.05-alpha3

## New Plugins
- `autoslab`: automatically create work orders to engrave slabs for ghostly dwarves

## Fixes
-@ DF screens can no longer get "stuck" on transitions when DFHack tool windows are visible. Instead, those DF screens are force-paused while DFHack windows are visible so the player can close them first and not corrupt the screen sequence. The "PAUSE FORCED" indicator will appear on these DFHack windows to indicate what is happening.
-@ allow launcher tools to launch themselves without hanging the game
-@ fix issues with clicks "passing through" some DFHack window elements to the screen below
- `getplants`: trees are now designated correctly
- `autoclothing`: fixed a crash that can happen when units are holding invalid items.
-@ `orders`: fix orders in library/basic that create bags
- `orders`: library/military now sticks to vanilla rules and does not add orders for normally-mood-only platinum weapons. A new library orders file ``library/military_include_artifact_materials`` is now offered as an alternate ``library/military`` set of orders that still includes the platinum weapons.
- `autochop`: fixed a crash when processing trees with corrupt data structures (e.g. when a trunk tile fails to fall when the rest of the tree is chopped down)

## Misc Improvements
-@ DFHack windows can now be "defocused" by clicking somewhere not over the tool window. This has the same effect as pinning previously did, but without the extra clicking.
- `getplants`: ID values will now be accepted regardless of case
-@ Windows now display "PAUSE FORCED" on the lower border if the tool is forcing the game to pause
-@ New borders for DFHack tool windows -- tell us what you think!
-@ `autoclothing`: merged the two separate reports into the same command.

- `orders`: orders plugin functionality is now accessible via an `overlay` widget when the manager orders screen is open
- `gui/quickcmd`: now has its own global keybinding for your convenience: Ctrl-Shift-A
- `seedwatch`: now persists enabled state in the savegame, automatically loads useful defaults, and respects reachability when counting available seeds

## Documentation
- `compile`: instructions added for cross-compiling DFHack for Windows from a Linux Docker builder
-@ Quickstart guide has been updated with info on new window behavior and how to use the control panel

## API
- ``Buildings::containsTile()``: no longer takes a ``room`` parameter since that's not how rooms work anymore. If the building has extents, the extents will be checked. otherwise, the result just depends on whether the tile is within the building's bounding box.
- ``Units::getCitizens()``: gets a list of citizens, which otherwise you'd have to iterate over all units the world to discover
- ``Screen::Pen``: now accepts ``top_of_text`` and ``bottom_of_text`` properties to support offset text in graphics mode
- `overlay`: overlay widgets can now specify a default enabled state if they are not already set in the player's overlay config file
- ``Lua::Push``: now supports ``std::unordered_map``

## Lua
- `helpdb`: new function: ``helpdb.refresh()`` to force a refresh of the database. Call if you are a developer adding new scripts, loading new plugins, or changing help text during play
- `helpdb`: changed from auto-refreshing every 60 seconds to only refreshing on explicit call to ``helpdb.refresh()``. docs very rarely change during a play session, and the automatic database refreshes were slowing down the startup of `gui/launcher` and anything else that displays help text.
- ``widgets.Label``: ``label.scroll()`` now understands ``home`` and ``end`` keywords for scrolling to the top or bottom
- ``widgets.List``: new callbacks for double click and shift double click
- ``dfhack.units.getCitizens()``: gets a list of citizens
-@ ``gui.ZScreen``: new attribute: ``defocusable`` for controlling whether a window loses keyboard focus when the map is clicked
- ``widgets.Label``: token ``tile`` properties can now be either pens or numeric texture ids
- `tiletypes`: now has a Lua API! ``tiletypes_setTile``

## Removed
- `autohauler`: no plans to port to v50, as it just doesn't make sense with the new work detail system

# 50.05-alpha2

## Fixes
-@ `autofarm`: don't duplicate status line entries for crops with no current supply
-@ `orders`: allow the orders library to be listed and imported properly (if you previously copied the orders library into your ``dfhack-config/orders`` directory to work around this bug, you can remove those files now)
- `tailor`: now respects the setting of the "used dyed clothing" standing order toggle

# 50.05-alpha1

## Fixes
- ``widgets.WrappedLabel``: no longer resets scroll position when window is moved or resized

## Misc Improvements
- Scrollable widgets now react to mouse wheel events when the mouse is over the widget
- the ``dfhack-config/scripts/`` folder is now searched for scripts by default
- `hotkeys`: overlay hotspot widget now shows the DFHack logo in graphics mode and "DFHack" in text mode
- `script-paths`: removed "raw" directories from default script paths. now the default locations to search for scripts are ``dfhack-config/scripts``, ``save/*/scripts``, and ``hack/scripts``
- ``init.d``: directories have moved from the ``raw`` subfolder (which no longer exists) to the root of the main DF folder or a savegame folder

## Documentation
- `overlay-dev-guide`: added troubleshooting tips and common development workflows
- added DFHack architecture diagrams to the dev intro
- added DFHack Quickstart guide

## API
- ``Gui::getDwarfmodeDims``: now only returns map viewport dimensions; menu dimensions are obsolete
- ``Gui::getDFViewscreen``: returns the topmost underlying DF viewscreen
- ``Screen::Pen``: now accepts ``keep_lower`` and ``write_to_lower`` properties to support foreground and background textures in graphics mode

## Lua
- Removed ``os.execute()`` and ``io.popen()`` built-in functions
- ``gui.View``: ``visible`` and ``active`` can now be functions that return a boolean
- ``widgets.Panel``: new attributes to control window dragging and resizing with mouse or keyboard
- ``widgets.Window``: Panel subclass with attributes preset for top-level windows
- ``widgets.CycleHotkeyLabel``: now supports rendering option labels in the color of your choice
- ``widgets.CycleHotkeyLabel``: new functions ``setOption()`` and ``getOptionPen()``
- ``widgets.ToggleHotkeyLabel``: now renders the ``On`` option in green text
- ``widgets.Label``: tiles can now have an associated width
- `overlay`: ``OverlayWidget`` now inherits from ``Panel`` instead of ``Widget`` to get all the frame and mouse integration goodies
- ``dfhack.gui.getDFViewscreen()``: returns the topmost underlying DF viewscreen
- ``gui.ZScreen``: Screen subclass that implements window raising, multi-viewscreen input handling, and viewscreen event pass-through so the underlying map can be interacted with and dragged around while DFHack screens are visible
- ``gui.View``: new function ``view:getMouseFramePos()`` for detecting whether the mouse is within (or over) the exterior frame of a view
- ``gui.CLEAR_PEN``: now clears the background and foreground and writes to the background (before it would always write to the foreground)
- ``gui.KEEP_LOWER_PEN``: a general use pen that writes associated tiles to the foreground while keeping the existing background

## Removed
- ``fix-job-postings`` from the `workflow` plugin is now obsolete since affected savegames can no longer be loaded
- Ruby is no longer a supported DFHack scripting language
