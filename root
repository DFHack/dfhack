The terminal cursor jumps to the last-drawn character (not necessarily the last one written to gps.screen), which makes it hard to track the DF cursor. Disabling the FPS counter helps some, but other blinking characters are still an issue.\n\nThe ncurses hooks necessary to make a setting like this possible would probably have to be in the core. Maybe the logic could be in a separate plugin, though.","files":null}]}
