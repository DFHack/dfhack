Since DT and Labormanager are not exactly on friendly terms when it comes to labor assignment that might not be important, though. In the somewhat longer term I'd like to see DF fixed so all citizens can be both assigned labors and viewed, however, and if that happens the Labormanager change might need to be re-examined.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"0541b7dd92e4d9285c31215454cda686ef6b8a4e"},"timestamp":1505975909,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTA2NTgxNA==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1142#issuecomment-331065814"},"message":"@PatrikLundell The fact that DT can assign labors to a unit by directly manipulating the unit's assigned labors array doesn't make it appropriate to do so.
