Loading from command line behaves correctly.\n\n2, Quality settings are not restored correctly from a preset. Partially fixed by https://github.com/Ramblurr/dfhack/commit/b9a2ecb440f4fd593dd46f575d70dbb3044d9194\n\nIssue: Create any preset with partially selected quality settings (or use the [Automelt preset](http://dffd.wimbli.com/file.php?id=10170)) and try to load it over a few stockpiles. Observe that the [quality is not always restored correctly,](http://i.imgur.com/wrrcNhr.png) success rate is random. When loaded, these incorrectly restored q.settings can only be deactivated by forbidding/permitting the category first, the control is not responsive to space until.\nA workaround is to 'preformat' the stockpile by loading the Animal preset first, then the desired setting.\n\nThis bugs are only reproducible on OSX, linux and windows not affected. Tested: 10.7.5 and 10.9.3","files":null}]}
