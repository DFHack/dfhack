It fails with the following message:\n\n./libs/Dwarf_Fortress: /pathToDF/libs/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.15' not found (required by ./hack/libdfhack.so)\n\n== Fix ==\nA fix is to disable the DF copy of libstdc++.so.6 (e.g. rename to end with .bak) and then symlink the system copy, e.g.\n\nln -s /usr/lib32/libstd++-libc6.2-2.so.3 /pathToDF/libs/libstdc++.so.6\n\nI happen to be running on 64-bit Debian testing.  Compiling happens without problems, it is just a dynamic link time problem.\n\n== Comment ==\nPerhaps you could put a comment about this in the Compile.{rst,html} files?\n\nCheers!","files":null}]}
