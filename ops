If variable area buildings or stockpiles are placed next to each other, quickfort can't figure out where one ends and the other begins. Also things like parts of buildings being cut off probably isn't handled vary well. There's an alternate syntax available that fixes this problem, but it would make blueprint generation more complex. I'm also not sure if digfort/buildplan support that syntax or not. It's something I'll look into once the base functionality is in place.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"fa1b8ca1364f5cc8665c39cc2513cf1301c3cc02"},"timestamp":1421177617,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5ODA0NDg5","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/479#issuecomment-69804489"},"message":"Stockpiles finished, same fort area and output is the same [gist as before](https://gist.github.com/cdombroski/9e9319f523c21d14ca4c).
