Travis allows credentials like these to be exposed to scripts as environment variables (and optionally encrypted), but does _not_ expose them when building pull requests, since nothing stops someone from modifying the build script to display credentials and making a pull request. Unfortunately, pull requests are exactly what `pr-check-base.py` is intended to check.\nOther ideas?","files":null}]}
