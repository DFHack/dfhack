It is just frequent enough that I remember to force save anytime after issuing a bunch of input...losing an hour or three of designations is painful.  \n\nContinuing from the exception using Visual Studio allowed me to save the game and restart without losing data in all but one case (once I thought to try that; the first few crashes I didn't think to open the debugger and see if I could force myself past).  The exception was generated from code invoked through the dll for TwbT; the exception itself was in some NT dll (presumably system level code for drawing to the real device).  The one case where I couldn't manage to force the game back into a state where I could save was induced by flipping a to-be-built pump such that one of its tiles was off the left side of the map.  The other instances were induced just by moving the view around, with no obvious triggering condition.  Maybe something to do with rendering lots of stuff at once, and maybe trees were a factor.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1456248219,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Nzc5OTczNw==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/811#issuecomment-187799737"},"message":"Okay, if this is a TwbT issue, it should be opened in mifki/df-twbt instead. @pronvit, any ideas?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"54edb2db9eb9b7cc6fbbb0681df88d5b1d14abe6"},"timestamp":1456258981,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Nzg4Njg3OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/811#issuecomment-187886879"},"message":"I'll play on Windows for a bit and will try to crash it.
