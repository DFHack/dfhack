A gui could simple execute the compiled tool binary. Like the git gui does, at least most of them, some are native reimplementations.

Another possible thing would be moving the logic to DF's side of the SHM bridge and provide the current API calls as SHM commands instead. Writing a wrapper then becomes extremely easy, because working with the SHM requires only a few functions.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"4f2823b111a40d19603a11dc9e0f3c589bea0f03"},"timestamp":1267335472,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjcwNg==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/11#issuecomment-146706"},"message":"``Almost there''","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"8d2ce3b475417480f1d2d4e2e77c691f4471a9f6"},"timestamp":1277868594,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MzE4MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/11#issuecomment-293180"},"message":"I'm working in a (almost done) Java application that will process whatever dfhack throws.
