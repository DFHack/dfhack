I don't expect that all of the plugins listed below will (or even should) be replaced by scripts, but it seems like a good place to start:\n- [x] catsplosion\n- [x] colonies - see #810\n- [x] drybuckets - see also #248\n- [x] feature\n- [x] fixpositions - to separate fix/diplomats and fix/merchants scripts\n- [x] initflags - to separate twaterlvl and tidlers scripts\n- [x] weather\n\nThe criteria for this list:\n- plugins provide one-use commands only (or repeat them regularly, replaceable with the repeat tool)\n- reasonably simple to re-implement\n- no persistent interaction or GUI elements\n- not too much indexing (which is way faster in C++)","files":null}]}
