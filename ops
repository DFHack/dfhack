Any way to reset that? Or better, get dfhack to avoid messing with the terminal state? :)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"20b694d874766b15e6137a91b7131cbaa64faed8"},"timestamp":1333889641,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTUyNTY=","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/123#issuecomment-5015256"},"message":"cat ~/fix-terminal.sh\n    #!/bin/bash\n    printf '\\033[3g\\033[0m\\033[?25h\\033(B\\017\\033%%G'","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"8da294348a2b44914db748e711fbe3738d027fe8"},"timestamp":1336162141,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MTkxOTU=","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/123#issuecomment-5519195"},"message":"Thanks, but I discovered that you can reset the terminal with ... the reset command.

DFHack works with the terminal in raw mode and does a lot of black magic that something like ncurses would do, except in a hacky way.\n\nThe terminal not being reset after crashes was a bug.
