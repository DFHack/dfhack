It works on r3 and r4 as far as I can tell, although I've mostly tested it in r3. It doesn't have any GUI integration yet, and it doesn't do anything special that dfusion's `embark` doesn't, but it's more portable since it doesn't require a patch for each platform.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"88b79c31fdfd52952dafcabb16168259734368cc"},"timestamp":1388630932,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDM1ODQ5","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/153#issuecomment-31435849"},"message":"@lethosor nice one!","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"f7b5a7930d0e1264ae1e4a774b03a7e78c2b7858"},"timestamp":1403507692,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODEyNTI5","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/153#issuecomment-46812529"},"message":"Now that [embark-tools](https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/pull/247) is in a released version and confirmed working, this issue could be closed.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"be523fe0f95fc478bda36c722e6f106f8f7a41b5"},"timestamp":1417211600,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjAwMDY5NTE2"},"status":2}]}
