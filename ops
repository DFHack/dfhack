There are other ways we could affect it (e.g. forcing a screen to appear that does nothing), but even then, the unresponsiveness during worldgen is due to DF only reading input occasionally, which also affects when DFHack can do something like that. In other words, you can pause worldgen by running something like command-prompt, but it won't be any more responsive than pressing Enter/Esc in-game.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1525550863,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE2MTE0MTU3MDg="},"added":["idea"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1525551070,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjgzMTYxMA==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1256#issuecomment-386831610"},"message":"Done (only committed a week or so late)","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1525551071,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTYxMTQxNjgxOQ=="},"status":2}]}
