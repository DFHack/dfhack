I personally don't like the approach in #1400 that much but I don't have a clearly better idea at the moment, so I'm OK with it going forward provided that the issues that @lethosor identified are dealt with.\n\nI do ask that you think carefully before you fork labormanager. We already have three labor managing plug-ins, all of which share a lot of common code and all of which are mutually incompatible. A fork would make that _four_ such plugins, and would add that much more maintenance headache whenever Toady changes the way the core game handles labors.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"8f3ac83641081eebd4303c5f403bdbc3092ae146"},"timestamp":1585335681,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNTIxNDgwMA==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1522#issuecomment-605214800"},"message":"While a burrow does work, it's also limiting and a clunky work around to making a dwarf be ignored by the manager.\n\nHrm, #1400 would solve it.
