So if your dwarfs are happy and praying you get power to do things like 'cast' reveal for a short period of time. Maybe this mod already exists but anyway, that's how I justify some of my DFHacking, heh.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e Ooh, nice idea for a script!  `cast $command` runs that command, and adds some stress to your dwarves. Alternatively, maybe you could have an option which sacrifices valuable items instead...\n\u003e \n\u003e Oh, I like that! A mechanic which, if abused, can result in your dwarfs having mental breakdowns! Plus it could be implemented without any big changes to the game if you base it off of stress. 'Urist was irritated by witnessing a supernatural phenomenon.' I'm thinking to have it impact everyone though since it would be more... interesting.\n\nBasically, a script which does something - possibly depending on what command it's given - then runs that command.  The idea is to add immersion or justify 'cheating' by adding a (optional) penalty to DFHack commands.","files":null}]}
