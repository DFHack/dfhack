On osx64 0.44.12, in_rename_hotkey is at 0x101be4572 (determined with devel/find-primitive), which is currently pointed to by ui.squads.unk_44_12h.\nhttps://github.com/DFHack/df-structures/pull/298 should partly fix this, but I'm pretty sure the unk_44_12 stuff from squads should be in main instead.\n\nPointed out on Bay12: http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=164123.msg7829567#msg7829567","files":null}]}
