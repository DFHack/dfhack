Specifically, it's now important that your fort has only a few dedicated corpse haulers who are mentally tough, rather than allowing everyone a chance to get traumatized after a big raid.\n\nWe should take dwarven psychology into account and make corpse hauling a special skill that only a few dwarves are allowed to perform.","files":null}]}
