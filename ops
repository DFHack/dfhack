There's nothing preventing mods from using scripts that aren't in the modtools folder. On the other hand, moving user-facing scripts to the modtools folder is poor for usability, since that can more than double the command length and hides the scripts from `ls` by default.\n\nMy general rule of thumb is that anyone not actively developing a mod should never have to type \"modtools/\". By this criteria, there are actually a couple scripts in modtools/ that probably shouldn't be there (but moving them out risks breaking mods if we don't leave an alias behind).","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"88b79c31fdfd52952dafcabb16168259734368cc"},"timestamp":1532705834,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwODQ1NjUwOQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1375#issuecomment-408456509"},"message":"I guess scripts can just call the full-heal script.\n\nI just worry that it will need hundred of params (e.g. leave scars, all etc...).","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"88b79c31fdfd52952dafcabb16168259734368cc"},"timestamp":1532705834,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTc1NzU2Mzk3Mw=="},"status":2},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1532706001,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwODQ1NzIxMw==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1375#issuecomment-408457213"},"message":"Module support from https://github.com/DFHack/scripts/pull/73 should make it easier for other scripts to use directly.","files":null},{"type":6,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1532706001,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDE1OlVzZXJDb250ZW50RWRpdDExMzI2MTE0OA=="},"target":"468fb06af4e9fb08d1d8e12616c464b30b43421cc33fe3a0976d864ca6434a80","message":"Module support from https://github.com/DFHack/scripts/pull/73 should make it easier for other scripts to use directly (or specific functions only).","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"88b79c31fdfd52952dafcabb16168259734368cc"},"timestamp":1532706245,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwODQ1ODUzNg==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1375#issuecomment-408458536"},"message":"Ah nice, missed that one.","files":null}]}
