This should be used to detect their type.\n\nThis is best seen on maps with a glacier or just about any ice. Aside from the standard vein, there's a another one that stores tile IDs for tiles that have been replaced by ice walls (guessing here, but it's probably not far from the truth). When the ice melts, the ice wall ID is then replaced by the content of this 'tile ID vein'.","files":null}]}
