Looking at the source code, I can see there is already implemented 'penalties' for specific roles, but I don't see any way to exploit that well without changes to the plugin.\nTwo possible strategies present themselves:\n1. Use some generic, in-game settable property of the dwarves to determine labor exemption (such as a nickname or unused labor such as alchemy)\n2. Have the autolabor plugin itself able to manage specific dwarves for exemption.  This would involve:\n- Selecting a dwarf from either the context of the cursor or using the dwarf's name\n- Persisting this data\n- Occasionally pruning this data to remove dead dwarves\n\nPersonally, I think using the property of a nickname would be pretty straightforward to implement and use.\n\nI think I could add this functionality pretty easily.  Can anybody think of any reason this wouldn't work?","files":null}]}
