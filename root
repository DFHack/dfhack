The advantage is that we can use well-documented and well-tested code for complicated things instead of implementing them ourselves, but the disadvantage is it would require adding more dependencies. An extra dependency wouldn't be too bad if we just added whatever libraries we use as git submodules.\n\nFor example, I already implemented something like Boost.PropertyTree in Lua in library/lua/persist-table.lua. Had I known this existed I could have saved some time.\n\nI'm posting this issue as a request for comment from other developers. Would people hate it if I did this?","files":null}]}
