I can export the legends to XML from DF without problems (although the file is some 44 GB). \n\nHowever, when running `exportlegends info` from dfhack I get the following error:\n\n    [DFHack]# exportlegends info\n    Exporting:  World map/gen info\n    Exporting:  Legends xml\n    Exporting:  Extra legends_plus xml\n    unknown reference\t48\tABSTRACT_BUILDING\n    unknown reference\t48\tABSTRACT_BUILDING\n\nWhich goes on some 188 times until DF crashes.\n\nI'd like to explore the legends with [LegendsBrowser](https://github.com/robertjanetzko/LegendsBrowser) which I believe needs the `legends_plus.xml` file (also because it threw an error when I tried to load the 44 GB XML).","files":null}]}
