If you want to copy your watchlist to\n\u003e another savegame you can use the command list_export::\n\u003e - Load savegame where you made the settings.\n\u003e - Start a CMD shell and navigate to the df directory. Type the following into the shell: `dfhack-run autobutcher list_export \u003e autobutcher.bat` (or .sh)\n\u003e -  Load the savegame where you want to copy the settings to, run the batch file (from the shell): `autobutcher.bat`\n\nThis script is very simple:  (eg)\n\n```\ndfhack-run autobutcher start\ndfhack-run autobutcher autowatch\ndfhack-run autobutcher sleep 6000\ndfhack-run autobutcher target 5 1 5 1 new\ndfhack-run autobutcher target 5 1 5 1 CAT\ndfhack-run autobutcher watch CAT\n```\n\nSurely there's a more elegant way to do this?  Even just exporting the file directly instead of requiring the user to pop another terminal would be an improvement!","files":null}]}
