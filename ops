Namely: you could create units (dunno about the state of our create-unit though) that are immune to various poisons. Then have 50% of current jobs (e.g. all smelting) emit poisonous gasses. This would make you build separated forts with golems doing the speciality work and managing interaction between two sides.\nBonus points: make golems be easily resurrectable (e.g. add energy source, repair corpse a bit...) \n\nAlso related: have undead work for you (if they have grasp/brains?) with huge machine powered obelisks.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"be523fe0f95fc478bda36c722e6f106f8f7a41b5"},"timestamp":1457864093,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NTkyNzg5MQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/862#issuecomment-195927891"},"message":"You'd have to be careful to make DFHack monitor jobs so poisonous jobs don't accidentally get assigned to normal units.\n\nI like the idea of powered / resurrecting golems.
