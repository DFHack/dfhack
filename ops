Often I have to adjust logs to ludicrously high numbers like 10000 when in a densely forested biome, and repeatedly smashing shift+j starts to hurt my wrists.\n\nMy suggestion is two fold:\n1.) Set the option so that you can type the min/max logs in. (Similar to wheelbarrows in stockpiles and workflow).\n2.) Set an option to ignore min max and just cut down any and all trees in the designated area(s).\n\nThanks everyone for all you do! Keep up the good work!","files":null}]}
