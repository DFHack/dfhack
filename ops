In other words, unless DF does effectively the same thing as this script when handling jobs, I'd say keeping it around (with documentation changes) wouldn't hurt. We'd need to do some research first to find out what the situation is, though.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1460343094,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDYyMTgyNDIxMQ=="},"added":["obsolete feature"],"removed":[]}]}
