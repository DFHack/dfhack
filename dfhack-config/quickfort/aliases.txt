# aliases for quickfort query mode blueprints
#
# This file defines custom keycode shortcuts for query mode blueprints.
# Definitions in this file take precedence over any definitions in the baseline
# aliases configuration file at hack/data/quickfort/aliases-common.txt. See that
# file for aliases that are already defined.
#
# If possible, build on the baseline aliases when defining your own aliases. If
# the DF UI screens change, updated baseline aliases may allow your aliases to
# automatically adapt to the new UI. For example, if you create an alias to
# modify particular furniture stockpile settings, start your alias with
# "{furnitureprefix}" instead of manually writing "s{Down 2}". Then, if the
# location of the furniture setting changes, your alias will automatically
# inherit the updated position when DFHack is updated.
#
# Aliases simplify repetitive tasks, such as configuring workshop profiles or
# adjusting a food stockpile to accept only seeds. Making new aliases is just a
# matter of mimicking the keys used to navigate through the menus and select
# options. Use the aliases in your blueprint spreadsheets by writing an alias by
# itself in a cell, like "nocontainers", or reference an alias in a larger
# sequence by enclosing in in curly brackets, like "{nocontainers}{linksonly}"
#
# For example, say you have the following build and place blueprints:
#
# #build start(4;1;upper left corner of stockpile) mason stockpile
# ~,  ~, ~, `, `, `
# ~, wm, ~, `, `, `
# ~,  ~, ~, `, `, `
#
# #place start(4;1;upper left corner of stockpile) build mason
# ~, ~, ~, s, s, s
# ~, ~, ~, s, s, s
# ~, ~, ~, s, s, s
#
# and you want to configure the stockpile to hold only non-economic ("other")
# stone and to give to the adjacent mason workshop. You could write the
# keystrokes directly:
#
# #query start(4;1;upper left corner of stockpile) configure mason
# ~, ~, ~, s{Down 5}deb{Right}{Down 2}p^, `, `
# ~, ~, ~, g{Left 2}&, `, `
# ~, ~, ~, `, `, `
#
# or you could use alias names:
#
# #query start(4;1;upper left corner of stockpile) configure mason
# ~, ~, ~, otherstone, `, `
# ~, ~, ~, give2left,  `, `
# ~, ~, ~, `,          `, `
#
#
# The syntax for defining aliases is:
#   aliasname: keystrokes
#
# Where aliasname is at least two letters or digits long and keystrokes are
# whatever you would type into the DF UI. A keystroke can also be a named
# keycode from the DF interface definition file (data/init/interface.txt),
# enclosed in curly brackets like an alias, like: "{Right}" or "{Enter}". In
# order to avoid naming conflicts between aliases and keycodes, the convention
# is to start aliases with a lowercase letter. You can add spaces in between
# keystrokes to make them easier to read. Spaces in keystroke sequences will be
# ignored. To insert a literal space, use "{Space}"
#
# Anything enclosed within curly brackets can also have a number after it,
# indicating how many times that alias or keycode should be repeated. For
# example: "{buildblocks 9}" or "{Down 5}".
#
# Ctrl, Alt, and Shift modifiers can be specified for the next keycode by adding
# them as keycodes. For example, Alt-h is written as "{Alt}h".
#
# Some frequently-used keystrokes are assigned shorthand characters. Think of
# them as single-character aliases that don't need to be surrounded in curly
# brackets:
#   &   expands to {Enter}
#   @   expands to {Shift}{Enter}
#   ~   expands to {Alt}
#   !   expands to {Ctrl}
#   ^   expands to {ESC}
#
# If you need literal verisons of the shorthand characters, surround them in
# curly brackets, for example: "{~}"
#
