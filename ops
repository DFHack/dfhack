This is easy to do for the furniture types buildingplan currently supports, but how can we do it generically? Say the filter says \"fire-safe building material\", how can I select a matching item in the game world?\n\n2) How do we assign just one of several items in a construction job?\n\nThis might become obvious once I start implementing, but just in case it's difficult, are there any special steps I have to take for assigning items to a suspended well construction job if not all items are available at the same time? Can I assign one item and keep the job suspended? are there any negative consequences of doing that?\n\nI haven't fully designed the item selection algorithm yet - it depends too much on the answers to the above two questions, but my overall plan is this:\n\n- general cleanup of buildingplan code (no logic or API changes) -- move business logic out of header files, split buildingplan-lib.h into buildingplan-planner.h and buildingplan-rooms.h, move gui code back into buildingplan.cpp\n- tighten up the API -- make all publicly unused methods private, remove direct access to mutable fields (this will be required for the persistent item filters feature request that was on the forums recently)\n- Use lua to allocate buildings so we get appropriate item filters\n- When assigning an item to a construction job, filter both by construction job filters and buildingplan filters\n- Generate gui material selection pages for each required item, use getFilters() to get how many items, display serialized filter at top of screen so players know what theyâ€™re selecting for, left, right arrow keys to switch between items","files":null}]}
