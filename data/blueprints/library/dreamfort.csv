#notes label(help) run me for the dreamfort walkthrough
"Welcome to Dreamfort! These blueprints will help you build a functional, secure, fully self-sustaining fortress that you can use as-is or extend to build the fortress of your dreams!"
""
"It can be difficult to apply a set of blueprints that you did not write yourself. This walkthrough will guide you through the high-level steps of building Dreamfort. Run ""quickfort run library/dreamfort.csv -n /checklist"" (or, if you're looking at the online version, switch to the ""checklist"" sheet) for a compact list of the commands you'll be running. Each level also has its own mini-walkthrough with more details."
""
"The final fort will have a walled-in area on the surface for livestock, trading, aboveground farming, and military training. One z-level down is the farming level, with related workshops and vents up to the surface for miasma prevention. The farming level also has a miniature dining hall and dormitory for use until you get the services and housing levels set up."
""
"Beyond those two, the other layers can be built in any order, at any z-level, according to your preference and the layout peculiarities of your embark site:"
"- The industry level has a compact, but complete set of workshops and stockpiles (minus what is already provided on the farming level)."
"- The services level has dining, hospital, marksman barracks, and justice services, plus a well system. It is 4 z-levels deep."
"- The guildhall level has large, empty rooms for building libraries, temples, and guildhalls."
- The suites level has fancy rooms for your nobles.
- The apartments levels have small but well-furnished bedrooms for your other dwarves.
""
"Run each level's ""help"" blueprint (e.g. ""quickfort run library/dreamfort.csv -n /surface_help"") for more details."
""
"Dreamfort has a central stairs-based design. For all Dreamfort levels, place the cursor on the center (undug) tile of the 3x3 stairs area when you apply the blueprints for that level. The first surface blueprint will designate a column of stairs that you can use as a guide. If you need to extend the stairs down further to lower levels, run ""quickfort run library/dreamfort.csv -n /central_stairs --repeat down,10"" with the cursor on the z-level below the lowest current stairs."
""
"Dreamfort blueprints take care of everything to get the fort up and running. You don't need to clear any extra trees or create any extra buildings or stockpiles (though of course you are free to do so). Blueprints that do require manual steps, like 'assign minecart to hauling route', will leave a message telling you so when you run them. Note that blueprints will designate buildings to build even if you don't have the materials needed to build them. You can use ""quickfort orders"" to automatically create the manager orders for all the needed items. Make sure your manager is available to validate all the incoming work orders!"
""
"There are some tasks common to all forts that Dreamfort doesn't specifically handle for you. For example, Dreamfort sets up a barracks, but managing squads is up to you. Here are some other common tasks that may need to be done manually (or with some other tool):"
- Exploratory mining for specific resources like iron
- Filling the well system with water
- Bringing magma up to the industry level to power magma forges/furnaces
- Manufacturing trade goods
- Assigning skilled labors to migrants (although the example professions included with DFHack will help with this)
"- Custom stockpile setups to assist with, for example, encrusting only high-quality items"
""
"Dreamfort works best at an embark site that is flat and has at least one soil layer. New players should avoid embarks with aquifers if they are not prepared to deal with them. Bring picks for mining, an axe for woodcutting, and an anvil for a forge. Bring a few blocks to speed up initial workshop construction as well. That's all you really need, but see the example embark profile in the online spreadsheets for a more complete setup."
""
"Other DFHack commands also work very well with Dreamfort, such as autofarm, autonestbox, prioritize, seedwatch, tailor, and, of course, buildingplan. An init file that gets everything configured for you is distributed with DFHack as hack/examples/init/onMapLoad_dreamfort.init."
Put that file in your Dwarf Fortress directory -- the same directory that has dfhack.init.
""
"Also copy the files in hack/examples/orders/ to dfhack-config/orders/ and the files in hack/examples/professions/ to professions/. We'll be using these files later. See https://docs.dfhack.org/en/stable/docs/guides/examples-guide.html for more information, including suggestions on how many dwarves of each profession you are likely to need at each stage of fort maturity."
""
"Once you have your starting surface workshops up and running, you might want to configure buildingplan (in its global settings, accessible from any building placement screen, e.g.: b-a-G) to only use blocks for constructions so it won't use your precious wood, boulders, and bars to build floors and walls. If you bring at least 7 blocks with you on embark, you can even set this in your onMapLoad.init file like this:"
on-new-fortress buildingplan set boulders false; buildingplan set logs false
""
"Directly after embark, run ""quickfort run library/dreamfort.csv -n /setup"" with your cursor on your wagon to set settings, and get started building your fort with ""quickfort run library/dreamfort.csv -n /surface1"" on the surface (see /surface_help for how to select a good spot). Read the walkthroughs for each level to understand what's going on and follow the checklist to keep track of where you are in the building process. Good luck, and have fun building an awesome Dreamfort-based fort!"
""

"Here is the recommended order for Dreamfort commands. You can copy/paste the command lines directly into the DFHack terminal, or, if you prefer, you can run the blueprints in the UI with gui/quickfort. See the walkthroughs (the ""help"" blueprints) for context and details. Also remember to read the messages the blueprints print out after you run them so you don't miss any important manual steps."

Note that it is more efficient for your miners if you designate your digging before they dig the central stairs past that level since the stairs are dug at a low priority. This keeps your miners focused on one level at a time. If you need to designate your levels individually due to caverns interrupting the sequence or just because it is your preference, run the level-specific dig blueprints (i.e. /industry1, /services1, /guildhall1, /suites1, and 5 levels of /apartments1) instead of running /dig_all."

-- Plumbing --
"This is a good time to fill your well cisterns, either with a bucket brigade or by routing water from a freshwater stream or an aquifer (see the library/aquifer_tap.csv blueprint for help with this)."
"Also consider bringing magma up to your services level so you can replace the forge and furnaces on your industry level with more powerful magma versions. This is especially important if your embark has insufficient trees to convert into charcoal. Keep in mind that moving magma is a tricky process and can take a long time. Don't forget to continue making progress through the checklist! If you choose to use magma, I suggest getting it in place before importing the military and smelting automation orders since they make heavy use of furnaces and forges."

#notes label(setup_help)
Makes common initial adjustments to in-game settings.
""
"The /setup blueprint is intended to be run once at the start of the game, before anything else is changed. Players are welcome to make any further customizations after this blueprint is run. Please be sure to run the /setup blueprint before making any other changes, though, so your settings are not overwritten!"
""
The following settings are changed:
"- The manager, chief medical dwarf, broker, and bookkeeper noble roles are assigned to the first suggested dwarf. This is likely to be the expedition leader, but the game could suggest others if they have relevant skills. Bookkeeping is set to the highest precision."
""
- Standing orders are set to:
  - only farmers harvest
  - gather refuse from outside (incl. vermin)
  - no autoloom (so the hospital always has thread -- we'll be managing cloth production with automated orders)
""
"- A burrow named ""Inside"" is created, but it's up to the player to define the area as the fort expands. It is intended for use in getting your civilians to safety during sieges. A military alert named ""Siege"" is also created and associated with the ""Inside"" burrow."
""
- Military uniforms get the following modifications:
  - all default uniforms set to replace clothing
"  - in the ""Metal armor"" uniform, the ""metal armor"" item is removed and replaced by ""metal breastplate"" and ""metal mail shirt"""
"  - in the ""Metal armor"" uniform, the ""metal legwear"" item is removed and replaced by ""metal greaves"""
""
"All default uniforms should also have a leather cloak added, but the position of the cloak in the equipment list changes for every embark. We suggest manually adding a leather cloak to your uniforms after running the /setup blueprint."
""
- Hotkeys are created for the 8 most interesting levels. Only the names are set -- it's up to the player to adjust them to actual locations in the (H) menu since the blueprint can't know where the levels will eventually be built. Feel free to replace any hotkeys with locations that *you* think are interesting : )
""
These are all set for your convenience. Nothing in Dreamfort depends on these settings staying as they are. Feel free to change any setting to your personal preference.

2 picks,for the two miners
2 battleaxes,for the two woodcutters
1 anvil,for the forge
food and seeds,as per usual
4 ropes,"for the hospital well and traction benches. you could build the ropes out of raw materials, but dwarves are usually too busy to do textile work at the start of the game."
7 blocks,for starting workshops and the temporary trade depot. necessary if you have buildingplan configured for blocks only.
many boulders,for quickly turning into more blocks. blocks are the limiting factor in the early stages.
dogs and cats,for protection and vermin control
geese,"for bones and leather. bring at least 1 male and 2 females for the 2 early nestboxes. autobutcher settings in the included onMapLoad_dreamfort.init file are optimized for raising geese. if you prefer another bird, be sure to adjust the autobutcher settings."

Sets up a protected entrance to your fort in a flat area on the surface.
Screenshot: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YL_vQJLB2YnUEFrAg9y3HEdFq3Wpw9WP
""
Features:
- A starting set of workshops and stockpiles (which you can later remove once you establish your permanent workshops and storage)
- Livestock grazing area with nestbox zones and beehives
"- Walls, roof, and lever-controlled gates for security"
- Barracks (with prisoner processing quantum dump)
- Trap-filled hallways for invaders
- Optional extended trap hallways (to handle larger sieges)
- Protected trade depot
- A grid of 1x1 farm plots (intended to be managed by DFHack autofarm)
""
Manual steps you have to take:
- Assign grazing livestock to the large pasture and dogs to the pasture over the central stairs (DFHack's autonestbox can manage the nestbox zones)
- Connect levers to the gates that match the names of the levers
- Assign minecarts to the trade goods and prisoner processing quantum stockpile hauling routes
""
Be sure to choose an embark site that has a flat area on the surface large enough to use these blueprints!
""
Surface Walkthrough:
"1) Choose a tile for your central fortress stairs. The terrain around that tile should be perfectly flat. Trees are ok, but no slopes, rivers, or lakes. To be sure that the tile you've chosen is in a good spot, set the cursor over that tile and run ""quickfort run library/dreamfort.csv -n /perimeter"". This will show you the eventual boundaries of the fort. Some wall segments might be missing due to existing trees, but that's ok. Make sure the area within the exterior wall is flat. Run ""quickfort undo library/dreamfort.csv -n /perimeter"" to clean up."
""
"2) With the cursor on the chosen tile, run /surface1 to clear surrounding trees and set up your pastures. Deconstruct your wagon to get it out of the way of our upcoming walls and floors. Remember to assign your dogs to the pasture around the staircase and your grazing animals to the large pasture. Your egg-layers will automatically get assigned to nestbox zones once the nestboxes are built, so you don't need to worry about them. You can let your cats roam free to chase vermin."
""
"3) Once the marked trees have been cleared, run /surface2 to setup starting workshops/stockpiles, channel out the miasma vents for the farming level, and start clearing trees from a larger area. If you haven't done it already, now is a good time to configure buildingplan to only build buildings with blocks, not logs or raw boulders. Do this by entering buildingplan's global configuration (""baG"") and ensuring the only generic building material allowed is ""blocks"". Run ""quickfort orders"" for /surface2."
""
"4) Once the channels are dug out and the trees are cleared, start digging the farming level one z-level down. Once you have run /farming2, come back to the surface and run /surface3 to cover the vents and build an enclosure around your central stairs. Although the vents will be covered with flooring, they will still work to prevent miasma on the farming level. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /surface3."
""
"5) Once all walls and floors have been constructed around the stairwell, run /surface4 to build floors and walls to support upcoming buildings and furniture. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /surface4."
""
"6) Once walls and floors have been constructed (including the small roof segment one z-level up over the barracks), run /surface5 to build furniture, gates, and the permanent trade depot. Remember to deconstruct the temporary trade depot once nobody is using it. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /surface5."
""
"7) Once at least the beehives and weapon rack are built, run /surface6 to configure the rooms and build the remaining walls and floors. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /surface6."
""
"8) Once you have enough dwarves to do a lot of building without starving other important tasks, run /surface7 to build the roof. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /surface7."
""
"9) For extra security, you can run /surface8 any time after /surface7 to extend the trap corridors. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /surface8."
""
"10) Once your industry and farming levels are set up and running, you can disassemble the surface workshops and remove the surface stockpiles. Disassembling a workshop scatters the items stored within it and cancels any pending jobs that happen to use those items. In order to avoid job cancellations, first set the surface workshops to not accept general work orders. Do this by entering query mode (""q""), selecting a workshop, entering the workshop profile (""P""), moving to work orders (right arrow), and hitting Enter. Then enter view mode (""t"") and check to see if any items in a workshop are marked with ""TSK"". Once no items in the workshop have that marker, you are free to disassemble that workshop."
""
Sieges and Prisoner Processing:
Here are some tips and procedures for handling seiges -- including how to clean up afterwards!
""
"- Ensure your ""Inside"" burrow includes only below-ground areas and safe surface areas of your fort. In particular, don't include the ""atrium"" area (where the ""siege bait"" zone is) or the trapped hallways."
""
"- When a siege begins, set the civilian alert to ""Siege"" to ensure all your civilians stay out of danger. Immediately pull the lever to close the outer main gate. It is also wise to close the trade depot and inner main gate as well. That way, if enemies get past the traps, they'll have to go through the soldiers in your barracks."
""
"- During a siege, use the levers to control how attackers path through the trapped corridors. If there are more enemies than cage traps, time your lever pulling so that the inner gates snap closed before your last cage trap is sprung. Then the remaining attackers will have to backtrack and go through the other trap-filled hallway."
""
"- If your cage traps fill up, ensure your hallways are free of uncaged attackers, then close the trap hallway outer gates and open the inner gates. Unset the civilian alert and allow your dwarves to reset all the traps -- make some extra cages in preparation for this! Then re-set the civilian alert to ""Siege"" and open the trap hallway outer gates."
""
"- Once the last attacker is caged, open all the gates and unset the civilian alert. Life is normal again!"
""
"After a siege, you can use the caged prisoners to safely train your military. Here's how:"
""
"- Once the prisoners are hauled to the ""prisoner quantum"" stockpile, run ""stripcaged all"" in the DFHack console."
""
"- After all the prisoners' items have been confiscated, bring your military dwarves to the barracks (if they aren't already there)."
""
- Use the zone (i) menu to assign a group prisoners to the pasture that overlaps the prisoner quantum stockpile
""
"- Hauler dwarves will come and release prisoners one by one. Your military dwarves will immediately pounce on the released prisoner and chop them to bits, saving the hauler dwarves from being attacked. Repeat until all prisoners have been ""processed""."
""
"Only common hostile creatures are accepted by the prisoner hauling route by default. You can add additional creature types by configuring the hauling route stop in the 'h' menu. Note that generated creature types, like necromancer experiments, can't be explicitly added. You have to (at least temporarily) accept all animals to include them."

#notes label(farming_help)
"Sets up farming, food storage, and related industries. Also provides post-embark necessities that can later be disassembled."
Screenshot: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fBC3G5Y888l4tVe5REAyAd_zeojADVme
""
Features:
- Pairs with the surface blueprints for vents that prevent miasma
- Farm plots (intended to be managed by DFHack autofarm)
- Plentiful food storage
- Refuse/corpse quantum stockpile
- Small dormitory and dining room for post-embark needs
- Small offices for your manager and bookkeeper
""
Workshops:
- Kitchen
- Brewery
- Butcher
- Fishery
- Tannery
- Farmer's Workshop
- Quern
- Screw Press
""
Manual steps you have to take:
- Check to make sure the lower office is assigned to your manager and assign the upper office to your bookkeeper (if different from your manager)
"- Assign a minecart to your refuse quantum stockpile hauling route (you can run ""assign-minecarts all"" at the DFHack prompt to do this)"
"- If the industry level is already built, configure the jugs, pots, and bags stockpiles to take from the ""Goods"" quantum stockpile (the one on the left) on the industry level"
""
Farming Walkthrough:
"1) Wait until you have channeled the miasma vents and cleared trees on the surface before digging out the farming level on the z-level below the surface, otherwise you will end up with extra ramps on the farming level and unprotected holes through the surface when you later chop down trees growing above empty space."
""
"2) Start digging with /farming1 and get started on manufacturing furniture by running ""quickfort orders"" on /farming2 and /farming3."
""
"3) Once the level is dug out, run /farming2 to build workshops, stockpiles, and the furniture we need to anchor the rooms. Remember to assign a minecart to the newly-designated quantum refuse dump. There are also jugs, pots, and bags stockpiles on this level that should be configured to ""take"" from the industry level stockpile once we get the industry level built."
""
"4) When the furniture is in place, run /farming3 to designate your starter dining room and dormitory and build the farm plots and remaining furniture. The blueprint also attempts to assign the lower office to your manager, but double-check this assignment in case your dwarves are in an unexpected order."
""
"5) Once your fort has enough free time to build the remaining doors, run /farming4. This will also enable seasonal fertilization for your farm plots. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /farming4."
""
"6) You can disassemble the dining room and dormitory once the services and apartments levels are up and running, if you like."
"#dig label(farming1) start(16; 18; central stairs) message(Once the area is dug out, continue with /farming2.)"
# this level is dug at priority 2 since it is dug in soil. it's worth the miner's time to stop digging the industry level and
# quickly dig out this one.

#notes label(industry_help)
Sets up workshops for all non-farming industries
Screenshot: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1emMaHHCaUPcdRbkLQqvr-0ZCs2tdM5X7
""
Features:
- Space-efficient layout for all workshops
- Manager orders that automate basic fortress maintenance
"- Space available underneath the forge and smelters for magma, allowing the starting forge and smelters to be eventually replaced by magma versions."
- Quantum stockpiles for compact storage
with separate stockpiles for:
- A reserve of uncut gems for strange moods that the jeweler's workshop cannot take from
"- Wood, steel bars, and coal so you can see at a glance if you're low on stock"
- Items that cannot be quantum stockpiled (e.g. lye and sand bags)
- Meltable weapons and armor
""
Workshops:
- 2x Mason
- 4x Craftsdwarf
- 1x Jeweler
- 1x Mechanic
- 4x Smelter
- 1x Forge
- 1x Glassmaker
- 1x Kiln
- 4x Wood furnace
- 1x Ashery
- 1x Soap maker
- 1x Carpenter
- 1x Siege workshop
- 1x Bowyer
- 1x Dyer
- 1x Loom
- 1x Clothier
""
""
Manual steps you have to take:
- Assign minecarts to your quantum stockpile hauling routes
"- Give from the ""Goods"" quantum stockpile to the jugs, pots, and bags stockpiles on the farming level"
- Copy the fort automation manager orders (the .json files) from hack/examples/orders/ and put them in your dfhack-config/orders/ directory.
""
Optional manual steps you can take:
- Restrict the Mechanic's workshop to only allow skilled workers so unskilled trap-resetters won't be tasked to build mechanisms.
"- Restrict the Craftsdwarf's workshops to only allow labors that take from the adjacent stockpiles. That is, only allow Woodcrafting for the Craftsdwarf's workshop on the left near the wood stockpile, Stonecrafting and Strand Extraction for the Craftsdwarf's workshop near the Mason's workshops, and Bonecrafting for one of the Craftsdwarf's workshop near the Clothier's workshop. The last Craftdwarf's workshop can hold all the remaining labors, or it can be a secondary workshop for a labor that you want more dwarves working on."
"- To encourage your masons to concentrate on building blocks and other high-volume orders, it helps to set one of your Mason's workshops to service a maximum of 2 manager orders at a time."
"- Once you have enough haulers, you can increase the rate of stone and ore hauling jobs by building more wheelbarrows and adding them to the stone and ore feeder stockpiles."
"- If desired, set one or both stockpiles in the bottom left to auto-melt. This results in melting all weapons and armor that are inferior to masterwork. This is great for upgrading your military, but it takes a *lot* of fuel unless you have first replaced the forge and smelters with magma versions. If you enable automelt and you don't have magma forges and magma smelters, be sure to be in a heavily forested area, enable auto-chop, and keep your coal stocks high."
""
Industry Walkthrough:
"1) Start digging out /industry1 as soon as you find a stone layer at least two layers beneath the surface so the boulders can be used by your starting workshops. The services level is intended to be dug beneath this one, and there is space on that level to route magma underneath your furnaces so you can replace the furnaces on this level with magma-powered equivalents."
""
"2) Queue up manufacturing by running ""quickfort orders"" on /industry2. You brought an anvil with you (right??), so you can remove the unneeded anvil work order from the manager orders screen (j-m). Note that stockpiles that accept containers may claim the barrels you need to build the Dyer's Workshop and Ashery. If you see those two buildings not being constructed, build a few extra barrels or run combine-plants and combine-drinks to free up some existing ones."
""
"3) Once the area is dug out, run /industry2. Remember to assign minecarts to to your quantum stockpile hauling routes, and if the farming level is already built, give from the ""Goods"" quantum stockpile (the one on the left) to the jugs, pots, and bags stockpiles on the farming level."
""
"4) Once you have enough dwarves to do maintenance tasks (that is, after the first or second migration wave), run ""orders import basic"" to use the provided basic.json to take care of your fort's basic needs, such as food, booze, and raw material processing."
""
"5) If you want to automatically melt goblinite and other low-quality weapons and armor, mark the south-east stockpiles for auto-melt. If you don't have a high density of trees to make into charcoal, though, be sure to route magma to the level beneath this one and replace the forge and furnaces with magma equivalents."
""
"6) Once you have magma furnaces (or abundant fuel) and more dwarves, run ""orders import furnace"", ""orders import military"", and ""orders import smelting"" to import the remaining fort automation orders. The military orders are optional if you are not planning to have a military, of course."
""
"7) At any time, feel free to build extra workshops or designate custom stockpiles in the unused space in the top and bottom right. The space is there for you to use!"

#notes label(services_help)
"Sets up public services (dining, hospital, etc.)"
Screenshot: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13vDIkTVOZGkM84tYf4O5nmRs4VZdE1gh
""
Features:
- Spacious dining room/tavern (tavern is restricted to residents-only by default)
- Prepared food and drink stockpiles
- Well cistern system (bring your own water)
- Hospital with a well for washing
- Garbage dump
- Empty space for magma to power forges and smelters in the industry level above
""
Note the hospital also has animal training enabled so it can be used with the dwarfvet plugin if it's enabled.
""
Manual steps you have to take:
"- If you want to tavern to attract visitors, change the restriction in the (l)ocation menu."
"- Fill the cisterns with water, either with a bucket brigade or by plumbing flowing water. Fill so that there are two z-levels of 7-depth water to prevent muddiness. If you want to fill with buckets, designate a pond zone on the level below the main floor. If you feel adventurous and are experienced with water pressure, you can instead route (depressurized!) water to the second-to-bottom level (the one above the up staircases)."
"- If you are filling the wells with a bucket brigade and at least one well is already constructed, you'll run into issues with the dwarves stealing water from one well to fill another. Temporarily deconstruct the wells or temporarily build grates beneath the wells to block the buckets to avoid this issue. Remember to rebuild the wells or remove the grates afterwards, though!"
- Assign the office to the right of the barracks to your Sheriff/Captain of the Guard to use it as an interrogation room.
""
Services Walkthrough:
1) Start this level when your fort grows to about 50 dwarves so everyone has a place to eat.
""
2) Start digging with /services1. Note that this digs out the main level and three levels below for the wells.
""
"3) Once the area is dug out, set up important furniture, stockpiles, hospital zone and garbage dump zone with /services2. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /services2."
""
"4) When the table and chair have been placed in the dining room, the beds are placed in the rented rooms, and the weapon rack and archery targets are constructed in the barracks, run /services3 to build the rest of the furniture and configure your dining room/tavern and barracks. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /services3."
""
5) Fill the wells with either bucket brigades or by carefully routing flowing water.
""
"6) When your fort is mature enough to need jail cells, run /services4 to set those up, anytime after the restraints are built in the jail cell block. You also get some decorative statues to increase the value of your dining hall. Assign the office to the right of the barracks to your Sheriff/Captain of the Guard to use it as an interrogation room. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /services4."

"Eight 7x7 rooms for guildhalls, temples, libraries, etc."
Screenshot: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17jHiCKeZm6FSS-CI4V0r0GJZh09nzcO_
""
Features:
"- Big rooms, optionally pre-furnished. Double-thick walls to ensure engravings add value to the ""correct"" side. Declare locations from the pre-created meeting zones as needed."
""
Guildhall Walkthrough:
1) Dig out the rooms with /guildhall1.
""
"2) Once the area is dug out, pre-create the zones and add doors and a few statues with /guildhall2. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /guildhall2."
""
"3) Furnish individual rooms manually, or get default furnishings for a variety of room types by running /guildhall3. If you use the default furnishings, also run ""quickfort orders"" for /guildhall3. Declare appropriate locations from the pre-created zones as you need guildhalls, libraries, and temples. If you'd like a ""no specific diety"" temple declared for the top room and a library declared for the bottom room, run /guildhall4. Both locations will be ""Residents only"" by default, but you can change this in the (l)ocation menu if you want them to attract visitors. If you need more rooms, you can dig another /guildhall1 in an unused z-level."

""
Features:
- Well-appointed suites to satisfy nobles
- Apartments with beds and storage to keep dwarves happy and the fortress clean
- Apartments also serve as burial chambers since dwarves like looking at coffins
- Meta blueprint included for designating 5 levels of apartments for a full 200+ dwarves
""
Suites Walkthrough:
1) Dig out the suites layer with /suites1.
""
"2) Once the area is dug out, furnish the suites with /suites2. The rooms are left unconfigured so you can assign them to specific nobles. Each room can serve as a bedroom, a dining hall, an office, and/or a tomb. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /suites2."
""
Apartments Walkthrough:
"1) Dig out one layer of apartments with /apartments1, or 5 layers at once (enough for 200 dwarves) with by adding ""--repeat down,5"" to the quickfort command."
""
"2) Once a layer is dug out, build beds with /apartments2. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /apartments2."
""
"3) Once the beds are built, configure the rooms and build the remaining furniture with /apartments3. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /apartments3."
""
"4) Once the coffins are all in place, run ""burial -pets"" to set them all to accept burials."
