#notes label(help)
A pump stack is useful for moving water or magma up through the z-levels.
""
"These blueprints can be used from the quickfort commandline, but are much easier to use with the visual interface. That way you can check the vertical path interactively before you apply. Run gui/quickfort pump_stack"
""
"1) Select the ""dig"" blueprint and position the blueprint preview on the bottom level of the future pump stack. It should be on the z-level just above the liquid you want to pump."
""
"2) Enable repetitions with the ""R"" hotkey and lock the blueprint in place with the ""L"" hotkey. Move up the z-levels to check that the pump stack has a clear path and doesn't intersect with any open areas (e.g. caverns). Increase the number of repetitions with the ""+"" or ""*"" hotkeys if you need the pump stack to extend further up. Unlock the blueprint and shift it around if you need to, then lock it again to recheck the vertical path."
""
"3) If you need to flip the pump stack around to make it fit through the rock layers, enable transformations with the ""t"" hotkey and rotate/flip the blueprint with Ctrl+arrow keys."
""
"4) Once you have everything lined up, hit Enter to apply. If the height ends up being one too many at the top, manually undesignate the top level."
""
"5) Since you do not need to transmit power down below the lowest level, replace the channel designation on the middle tile of the bottom-most pump stack level with a regular dig designation. Likewise, replace the Up/Down staircase designation on the lowest level with an Up staircase designation. Otherwise you might get magma critters climbing up through your access stairway!"
""
"6) After the stack is dug out, prepare for building by setting the buildingplan plugin material filters for screw pumps (b-M-s-M). If you are planning to move magma, be sure to select magma-safe materials (like green glass) for all three components of the screw pump."
""
"7) Finally, position the cursor back on the access stairs on the lowest level and run the ""build"" blueprint with the same repetition and transformation settings that you used for the ""dig"" blueprint. As you manufacture the materials you need to construct the screw pumps, your dwarves will build the pump stack from the bottom up."
""
"Sometimes, a screw pump will spontaneously deconstruct while you are building the stack. This will reduce the efficiency of the stack a little, but it's nothing to worry about. Just re-run the ""build"" blueprint over the entire stack to ""fix up"" any broken pieces. The blueprint will harmlessly skip over any correctly-built screw pumps."
