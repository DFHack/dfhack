I think I already have a suspicion on what it is, but it doesn't hurt to make sure. Whenever I attempt to exportlegends info on my world, I get this error:\n\n```\nExporting: Extra legends_plus xml\n        historical figure 10000/21035 (48%)\n        historical figure 20000/21035 (95%)\n...s\\Dwarf Fortress 0.44.12/hack/scripts/export legends.lua:605: Cannot read field vector\u003ccaste_raw*\u003e. 1: index out of bounds.\nstack traceback:\n            [C]: in metamethod '__index'\n            ...ss\\Dwarf Fortress 0.44.12/hack/scripts/exportlegends.lua:605: in global 'export_more_legends_xml'\n            ...ss\\Dwarf Fortress 0.44.12/hack/scripts/exportlegends.lua:776: in global 'export_legends_info'\n            ...ss\\Dwarf Fortress 0.44.12/hack/scripts/exportlegends.lua:829: in local 'script_code'\n            ...warf Fortress\\Dwarf Fortress 0.44.12\\hack\\lua\\dfhack.lua:680: in function 'dfhack.run_script_with_env'\n            (...tail calls...)\n```\n\nI tried reinstalling the game and dfhack all fresh. I thought maybe that the Lazy Newb Pack I downloaded was corrupted or something, so I tried downloading Dwarf Fortress and DF hack from the main websites, and that didn't work. I am not running this game vanilla so, I came to the conclusion that maybe it was one of the three mods I am using (not including the Meph graphics pack I use)? The mods I am using are Arctic Addition, Succubus Dungeon, and Dark Ages III War \u0026 Mythos. With just Arctic Addition and Succubus Dungeon, I was able to use exportlegends info just fine, but when I threw Dark Ages back in it, I ended up getting this error again. Is it possible that there are simply too many things creatures and other things in the Dark Ages mod pack and exportlegends info can't handle a Dwarf Fortress game with so many additions? I do not believe it is a mod compatability issue--I have edited the files in myself, going through each line in the raws to make sure I'm changing and adding things in correctly and I can play the game without any issues with these mods.\n\nFor those who want to check the game save, here is a link to download it: https://www.dropbox.com/s/634rwtdfl31soyc/region1.rar?dl=0","files":null}]}
