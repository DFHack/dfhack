I got it to happen with a clean install of 0.43.05-r1 on Windows 10, though.\n\nSpecifically, stderr.log contains the following:\n```\nFirstCall()\nInitized HOOKS!\n```\nand stderr.txt contains everything else, starting with:\n```\nDFHack build: 0.43.05-r1-65-gcc0220f0\n```\n\nIt would be good to fix this, because there's no reason DFHack should be logging to that file and it makes troubleshooting harder.","files":null}]}
