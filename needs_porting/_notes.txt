Notes by PeridexisErrant, on the needs_porting scripts and plugins:

I deleted:
	attachtest.py 		obsolete
	digger.cpp			less useful than digger2, replaced by autochop
	digger2.cpp			replaced by digfort
	dfstatus.cpp		replaced by dfstatus.lua
	drawtile.cpp		replaced by tiletypes
	fix-3708.cpp		obsolete, bug fixed in vanilla
	lair.cpp			replaced by lair
	reveal.py			replaced by reveal
	treedump.py			replaced by prospect & autochop
	veinlook.cpp		replaced by prospect
	veinswap.cpp		replaced by changevein


To investigate further:
	creaturemanager.cpp		modify skills and labors of creatures, kill creatures, etc; impressive but I suspect most functions implemented elsewhere
	digpattern.cpp			allows multi-Z designations.  Obsolete, or is there more here?
	incrementalsearch.cpp	linux-only memory stuff; unqualified to judge
	SegementedFinder.h		more memory stuff


To port:  
	copypaste.cpp		high value target - a proof of concept plugin to allow copy-pasting in DF; does both terrain and buildings/constructions
	dfbauxtite.cpp		changes material of mechanisms to bauxtite (ie magma-safe)
	hellhole.cpp		instantly creates a hole to the HFS
	hotkeynotedump.py	outputs a list of hotkeys and names; most useful before keybindings were possible.  Trival to port but low value.
	itemdesignator.cpp	mostly replaced by Falconne's enhanced stocks, but could port the interesting 'set fire to things' function
	position.py			outputs very detailed time& place info
