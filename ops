I'm not expecting a miracle fix here. Was just wondering if it was common for the in game text to have so much difficulty in displaying. Almost every word of any importance; names, materials, etc. Is completely unreadable because it becomes obscured. How I get around this issue is just pull up the description of the item. For some reason, it's not obscured there. Either that or it's rarely obscured. The obscuring happens on the trade screen, the stocks screen, the military screen, anywhere that is important to know what exactly it says. In the image provided, is a good day. Usually it's much worse.\n![Proof](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4111894/360719/6eda42bc-a1a5-11e2-9d4e-411acb0c3c44.PNG)\n Also, if there is any way to fix it, I would much like to know. If not, oh well, will just have to start again.","files":null}]}
