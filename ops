The latter omits the equal sign in its equivalent condition, on line 274.  I have a lua script that demonstrates the issue, if you need it for testing.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"4f2823b111a40d19603a11dc9e0f3c589bea0f03"},"timestamp":1366818168,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDY0NDcyMTk="},"status":2},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"4f2823b111a40d19603a11dc9e0f3c589bea0f03"},"timestamp":1366818212,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTQxMzQx","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/195#issuecomment-16941341"},"message":"This was a well researched and documented bug, thanks to you :)","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1423175649,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzMTExODcwMg=="},"added":["bug"],"removed":[]}]}
