There is a pretty limited number of commands, and if I'm interested in a string it'd be useful to search both all the time. I'm not sure if that's what you meant. Does `ls` deal with files/folders on disk as well? I've only ever used it to list commands.\n\n\u003e What would you think of a script search.lua that opened the html docs search page, with any args to the script as search parameters?\n\nThe online docs are already good enough at doing searches. If I need full help then using the online docs is not a problem for me. I'm already going to the wiki for in-depth information anyway. This request is really about finding the command I want, rather than providing help. So while something like this might be nice, it wouldn't fit the request.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1460841300,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDYzMDA4NzAyOQ=="},"added":["idea"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1460841300,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDYzMDA4NzAzMQ=="},"added":["internal"],"removed":[]}]}
