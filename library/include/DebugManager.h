 * \brief Container holding all registered runtime debug categories
 * Singleton DebugManager is a minor extension to std::vector that allows signal
 * callbacks to be attached from ui code that manages.
 *
 * To avoid parallel plugin unload causing issues access to DebugManager must be
 * protected by mutex. The access mutex will be taken when
 * DFHack::DebugCategory::~DebugCategory performs unregister calls to
 * DFHack::DebugManager. The mutex will protect from memory disappearing while
 * ui code is accessing or changing the runtime state.
 *
 * Signal emitting happens from a locked contexts. Taking the
 * DFHack::DebugManager::access_mutex_ in a signal callback will results to a
 * deadlock.
 *
 * The interface is extremely simple but enough to implement persistent filter
 * states and runtime configuration code in a plugin.
