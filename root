When player requests via manager to make (for example) 30 swords the jobs will be split across all forges including those which through Profile being assigned to specific dwarfs with weaponsmiting labor disabled. Those jobs will never done nor canceled, forge will be unusable for assigned dwarfs. Manager should skip such workshops.\n2. When player requests 30 bronze helms  jobs are split across all forges including ones which linked to a bar/block storage with only steel allowed. Those jobs will get canceled with announcement 'not enough bronze' very soon, then get reassigned, canceled and so on until some other forge not finished them all. Manager should skip such workshops.\n\nI'm intend to take care of it myself since I am programmer, but I never hacked dfhack before and never did revers engineering/decompiling so I will accept any help and good advices.","files":null}]}
