I hope this makes sense to you - basically, allow someone using dfliquids to designate a rectangle of liquid in a similar way to how they'd designate a rectangle to be dug out or whatever.\n(love the tool, by the way)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"4f2823b111a40d19603a11dc9e0f3c589bea0f03"},"timestamp":1274123315,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDIzNw==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/23#issuecomment-244237"},"message":"Yes. It's possible to find that. With some state tracking and the 'dfhack stuff' actually being in a separate thread, it should be just fine.

If dfhack can read burrow data then for any burrow named 'dfhack' for example it would use that as the selection. That would allow people to not only paint exactly what they want filled.. but fill it again later with ease.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"2182ad57f6c7d53407dc493295dd8351df3186d6"},"timestamp":1332245505,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTM5MzQ=","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/23#issuecomment-4593934"},"message":"Since the forum link at the top is dead I can only guess what it was about. liquids already has a range mode and you can call it more than once with the given specs. But what sucks is that it canÂ´t be bound to a hotkey so you need to switch back and forth between game and dfhack to paint more complex stuff - so I decided to work on that.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"4f2823b111a40d19603a11dc9e0f3c589bea0f03"},"timestamp":1332262152,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTk4MzQ=","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/23#issuecomment-4599834"},"message":"Yeah.
