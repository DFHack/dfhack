If you have a magic sword that increases strength while wielded, you don't really need to monitor every equipment change of every unit. You just have to monitor new units, unequips of units already wielding that type of magic sword, and new equips of existing units. Internally monitor the number of equipment items each unit has to assist with this.","files":null}]}
