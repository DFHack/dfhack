Just very very difficult.\n\nIn this case almost everything can be done easily (getMachineInfo could return some part of our memory - custom tracked or in some evil casting nightmare) but the hard part is how machines connect to each other (which needs work either way - it still has order of operations bug). The vmethod that is used for that is `canConnectToMachine` and i think in furnace case it might be not the same (i.e. return always false) as workshop.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1546028336,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDQyMDkxMA==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1366#issuecomment-450420910"},"message":"Adding machine info to furnaces is probably more trouble than it's worth, at least for now.
