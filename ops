For the human soldiers in my army, I would like to produce some human-sized armor, and I would like Workflow to keep track of how much of it I have. The problem is, if I use Workflow to do this, it will only track the total number of shirts/breastplates etc. and not the number of large or human-sized items. It would be nice if I could set limits based on particular item sizes.","files":null}]}
