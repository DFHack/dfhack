    :no-command:

When enabled, this plugin adds a :kbd:`q` menu for track stops, which is
completely blank in vanilla DF. This allows you to view and/or change the track
stop's friction and dump direction settings, using the keybindings from the
track stop building interface.

Usage

::

    enable trackstop
