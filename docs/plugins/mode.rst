    produce undesirable results. There are a few good ones though.

Usage
-----

``mode``
    Print the current game mode.
``mode set``
    Enter an interactive commandline menu where you can set the game mode.

Scenario 2:

* You are in fort game mode, managing your fortress and paused at the Esc menu.
