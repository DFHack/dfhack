This can be remedied by tweaking priorities with the \"labormanager priority\" console command, as per the documentation.\n\nHauling jobs tend to fall behind other jobs because hauling jobs do not get the priority bump for \"time since last assigned\" that other jobs do. This is because DF internally only generates hauling jobs if there is someone enabled for hauling that type of item (which means labormanager has to always ensure that one dwarf is enabled for all of the hauling categories), and also because it's not always possible to determine which labor a dwarf that is currently doing a hauling job is actually using.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"0541b7dd92e4d9285c31215454cda686ef6b8a4e"},"timestamp":1495441506,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMzAzMzA0Mg==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1094#issuecomment-303033042"},"message":"I contacted the original reporter via reddit, asking for a save that demonstrated this issue, and he reported that he could not replicate the bug.\n\nClosing, for now at least.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"0541b7dd92e4d9285c31215454cda686ef6b8a4e"},"timestamp":1495441506,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTA5MTM2MzMxNA=="},"status":2},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1496780417,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDExMTI1MTAzMDQ="},"added":["labormanager"],"removed":[]}]}
