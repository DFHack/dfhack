See the report from VirusTotal below:\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/fcb52de87e5bf28f56dba244486c2993f15c19cb5e4d8110d5ceeaa255f2f470/behavior\n\nThe version I downloaded before seems to match what's in releases on GitHub. As you can see from the report, it access some IP addresses and writes some registry keys.\n\nIs this some debug stuff that was accidentally left in place? I saw that it was reported on Reddit at one point but was shut down with the typical \"virus detection engines are overzealous\" lines, but this does seem a bit dodgy, especially when you compare the r3 version which tries to access... nothing. :P","files":null}]}
