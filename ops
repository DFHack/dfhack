So you want this to work in a saved arena? I'm not sure why it wouldn't work there, because it doesn't check the game mode or anything like that. If you're just looking to do this on a per-save basis, that's fine with me. I'd be a little more wary of enabling it on a global basis (for every loaded arena) because some init.d scripts might not be designed for the arena.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1525828183,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE2MTY1ODU3NTQ="},"added":["idea"],"removed":[]}]}
