I'm using the default options in planning mode. Manually trying to unsuspend the jobs or using \"unsuspend\" and \"resume\" all do nothing, however manually building the items via the normal mechanic works. I tried getting it to work both before and after having the necessary items available. I'm using the current release version of dfhack with workflow disabled.","files":null}]}
