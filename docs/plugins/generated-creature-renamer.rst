Usage
-----

``enable generated-creature-renamer``
    Rename generated creatures when a world is loaded.
``list-generated [detailed]``
    List the token names of all generated creatures in the loaded save. If
    ``detailed`` is specified, then also show the accompanying description.
``save-generated-raws``
    Save a sample creature graphics file in the Dwarf Fortress root directory to
    use as a start for making a graphics set for generated creatures using the
    new names that they get with this plugin.

The new names are saved with the world.
