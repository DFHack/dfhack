However pressing ENTER on such job do switch it, but doesn't change cell background so you can't tell which jobs are turned on and which off. Dabbling skill jobs (i.e. '0') work fine.\n\nThis bug is platform-specific. I've reproduced it on different Windows platforms, but on Linux everything is fine. I haven't tested it on Mac.\n\nIt effectively renders manipulator unusable on Windows (as you often need to designate jobs to dwarves without any skill).","files":null}]}
