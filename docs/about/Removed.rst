Removed tools
#############

This page lists tools (plugins or scripts) that were previously included in
DFHack but have been removed. It exists primarily so that internal links still
work (e.g. links from the `changelog`).

.. contents:: Contents
  :local:
  :depth: 1

.. _autohauler:

autohauler
==========
An automated labor management tool that only addressed hauling labors, leaving the assignment
of skilled labors entirely up to the player. Fundamentally incompatible with the work detail
system of labor management in v50 of Dwarf Fortress.

.. _command-prompt:

command-prompt
==============
Replaced by `gui/launcher --minimal <gui/launcher>`.

.. _create-items:

create-items
============
Replaced by `gui/create-item --multi <gui/create-item>`.

.. _deteriorateclothes:

deteriorateclothes
==================
Replaced by the new combined `deteriorate` script. Run
``deteriorate --types=clothes``.

.. _deterioratecorpses:

deterioratecorpses
==================
Replaced by the new combined `deteriorate` script. Run
``deteriorate --types=corpses``.

.. _deterioratefood:

deterioratefood
===============
Replaced by the new combined `deteriorate` script. Run
``deteriorate --types=food``.

.. _devel/unforbidall:

devel/unforbidall
=================
Replaced by the `unforbid` script. Run ``unforbid all --quiet`` to match the
behavior of the original ``devel/unforbidall`` script.

.. _digfort:

digfort
=======
A script to designate an area for digging according to a plan in csv format.
Please use DFHack's more powerful `quickfort` script instead. You can use your
existing .csv files. Just move them to the ``blueprints`` folder in your DF
installation, and instead of ``digfort file.csv``, run
``quickfort run file.csv``.

.. _fix-armory:

fix-armory
==========
Allowed the military to store equipment in barracks containers. Removed because
it required a binary patch to DF in order to function, and no such patch has
existed since DF 0.34.11.

.. _fix/build-location:

fix/build-location
==================
The corresponding DF :bug:`5991` was fixed in DF 0.40.05.

.. _fix/diplomats:

fix/diplomats
=============
The corresponding DF :bug:`3295` was fixed in DF 0.40.05.

.. _fix/fat-dwarves:

fix/fat-dwarves
===============
The corresponding DF :bug:`5971` was fixed in DF 0.40.05.

.. _fix/feeding-timers:

fix/feeding-timers
==================
The corresponding DF :bug:`2606` was fixed in DF 0.40.12.

.. _fix/merchants:

fix/merchants
=============
Humans can now make trade agreements. This fix is no longer necessary.

.. _fortplan:

fortplan
========
Designates furniture for building according to a ``.csv`` file with
quickfort-style syntax. Please use DFHack's more powerful `quickfort`
script instead. You can use your existing .csv files. Just move them to the
``blueprints`` folder in your DF installation, and instead of
``fortplan file.csv`` run ``quickfort run file.csv``.

.. _gui/assign-rack:

gui/assign-rack
===============
This script is no longer useful in current DF versions. The script required a
binpatch <binpatches/needs-patch>`, which has not been available since DF
0.34.11.

.. _gui/hack-wish:

gui/hack-wish
=============
Replaced by `gui/create-item`.

.. _gui/no-dfhack-init:

gui/no-dfhack-init
==================
Tool that warned the user when the ``dfhack.init`` file did not exist. Now that
``dfhack.init`` is autogenerated in ``dfhack-config/init``, this warning is no
longer necessary.

.. _masspit:

masspit
=======
Replaced with a GUI version: `gui/masspit`.

.. _resume:

resume
======
Allowed you to resume suspended jobs and displayed an overlay indicating
suspended building construction jobs. Replaced by `unsuspend` script.

.. _ruby:
.. _rb:

ruby
====
Support for the Ruby language in DFHack scripts was removed due to the issues
the Ruby library causes when used as an embedded language.

.. _show-unit-syndromes:

show-unit-syndromes
===================
Replaced with a GUI version: `gui/unit-syndromes`.

.. _warn-stuck-trees:

warn-stuck-trees
================
The corresponding DF :bug:`9252` was fixed in DF 0.44.01.
