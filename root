Opening an issue mainly for tracking.\n\nA couple questions for @myk002:\n* The main page I've found is https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/blob/develop/data/blueprints/README.md - are there others that should also be moved over?\n* That page links to a couple files on GitHub (e.g. aliases-common.txt), which makes me wonder - are there any links *to* this page on GitHub that would need to be updated (so they don't 404 when README.md is removed)?\n\nAs a side note, I'd like to find a way to either bundle files like aliases-common.txt with the docs or link to the corresponding version on GitHub for versioned builds like https://docs.dfhack.org/en/0.44.12-r1/. Somewhat lower-priority, though.","files":null}]}
