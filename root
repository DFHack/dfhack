Seeing the \"Shift-Enter: All Seasons\" prompt at the bottom of the farm plot screen, I pressed the key combination, and DF instantly crashed. \n\nAs I was able to properly set all seasons with an underground plot mere minutes after relaunching, I believe this is an unhandled edge case. Ramblurr suggests that the plugin in question may be tweaks/farm-plot-select.","files":null}]}
