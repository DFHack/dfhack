# NOTE: This is dfhack's modification of the normal invocation script,
# changed to properly set LD_PRELOAD so as to run DFHACK.
#
# You can run DF under gdb by passing -g or --gdb as the first argument.
#
# If the file ".dfhackrc" exists in the DF directory or your home directory
# it will be sourced by this script, to let you set environmental variables.
# If it exists in both places it will first source the one in your home
# directory, then the on in the game directory.
#
# Shell variables .dfhackrc can set to affect this script:
#     DF_GDB_OPTS: Options to pass to gdb, if it's being run
#     DF_VALGRIND_OPTS: Options to pass to valgrind, if it's being run
#     DF_HELGRIND_OPTS: Options to pass to helgrind, if it's being run
#     DF_RESET_OPTS: Options to pass the reset command at the end of
#       this script
#     DF_POST_CMD: Shell command to be run at very end of script
