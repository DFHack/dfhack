Lycanthropy is a curse that one can get, by toppling a statue (or possibly other means), and if one is cursed with lycanthropy in this manner, that will show up on cursecheck. However, people who have acquired the lycanthropy syndrome by being bitten by someone else who has lycanthropy are not cursed, merely diseased. As such, they do not show up on cursecheck.\n\nIt would be worth adding this to the documentation for cursecheck, I suppose, but note that Toady changes these things around from time to time, without telling us, and so we're playing catchup the same as everyone else.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1546382313,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIwNDk2MTQ3MTE="},"added":["bug"],"removed":[]}]}
