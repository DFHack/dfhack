Pressing '1' in this case allocates the room to the relevant noble position instead of moving the cursor. \n\nThis is admittedly a rather minor thing, but it can lead to confusion if players accidentally auto-allocate rooms to certain nobles. It happened to me until I've found out what caused it.\n\n**How to reproduce:** \n\n1. Select a relevant furniture in a designated room (bed, table, chair).\n2. Use the Numpad to navigate while pressing one of the assigned keys.\n\n**DFHack version:**\n\n- 0.47.04-beta1\n\n**Platform \u0026 OS:** \n\n- Linux64, Ubuntu 20.04\n\nI haven't tried other platforms. It's possible that this is specific to Linux.\n\n**Possible solutions:**\n\n- Use different keys? a, f, r, l and x are already bound on that screen.\n- Don't toggle allocation if Numpad keys are used? Would that be even possible?","files":null}]}
