will be extended to newly-revealed adjacent walls.

Usage
-----

``burrow enable auto-grow``
    When a wall inside a burrow with a name ending in '+' is dug out, the burrow
    will be extended to newly-revealed adjacent walls. This final '+' may be
    omitted in burrow name args of other ``burrow`` commands. Note that digging
    1-wide corridors with the miner inside the burrow is SLOW.

    Disables auto-grow processing.

    Remove all tiles from the named burrows.
``burrow set-units target-burrow <burrow> [<burrow> ...]``
    Clear all units from the target burrow, then add units from the named source
    burrows.
``burrow add-units target-burrow <burrow> [<burrow> ...]``
