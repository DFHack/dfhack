It shouldn't be up to Lethosor (or any other DFHack contributor) to ensure that our sockets library supports basic error messages, or doesn't contain unused files or requests to send errors to defunct email addresses.\n\nGiven that there is in fact no shortage of socket libraries, can I suggest we replace it with something well-maintained, widely used, and available under the Zlib or MIT licenses?","files":null}]}
