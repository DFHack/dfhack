There's no method to get the size field.\n\nAdding something as simple as \n\n`uint32_t get_size() { return size; }`\n\nwould be enough.\n\nThe reason for this PR is that DF checks that size field in order to execute different code, but trying to replicate that code in DFHack is not possible because the field is private","files":null}]}
