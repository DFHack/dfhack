Having initally 17 sky levels with highest building at level 16. Then adding manually 8 levels via command \"InfiniteSky 8\" nets to a total of 25. Then building up the contruction to let's say Level 19. Suddenly the additional sky-levels disappear. Total levels drop down to 19 as there is currently the highest construction. (Which should actually not be possible as the game demands one empty sky level between the highest construction and the ceiling of the map). \n\nEven Weirder: The sudden drop causes cave-ins, when there are constructions going on, even some levels below, e.g. at level 14 of the tower.\n\nI prepared some screenshots. Those cave-ins shouldn't actually happen as the caved in tiles are directly connected to a staircase:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/glLa5tp.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ldG85cP.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/daUaXwW.png\n\nThe very same tiles could be built without problems, when increasing the SkyLevels manually again.\n\nCommand \"InfiniteSky Enable\" causes the same problems. Works at the beginning, but after a while (ranging from a few minutes to an hour or maybe more), the sky levels are reseted again the same way as described above.\n\nadd: Please note, the level-numbers above are just examples. Happens regularly at any levels.\n\nI am using the Standard Install of LazyNewbPack with the included tools like Dwarf Therapist. No other mods.","files":null}]}
