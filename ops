Alternatively they might be removed if it's judged not worth the bother:\n- [ ] `advtools`\n- [ ] `misery`\n- [ ] `treefarm`\n\nTools with duplicated functionality, or things that could be merged: (related to #722)\n- [ ] item creation: `createitem` plugin, `modtools/create-item`, `gui/create-item`.  Could drop the plugin, upgrade modtools and use it as a backend for the gui (with script_environment or similar)\n- [ ] `forceequip` plugin is mostly replaced by `modtools/equip-item`\n- [ ] `fastdwarf`, `teledwarf`, `superdwarf` - needs sorting out somehow.  See #664, #665.\n- More to come.  Adding links between similar commands in the documentation often uncovers possibilities.","files":null}]}
