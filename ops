We have the ability to completely rewrite it from scratch using vmethod interposing. Technically we can do opengl calls to do virtually anything but it would be best to make the graphics ncurses style at least at first. In particular we should overhaul the military viewscreen, because this confuses people. We should consider expanding `manipulator` to include more features from Dwarf Therapist.\n\nThe limiting factor is not technical limitations, it's the design. I don't know how to design a better user interface. We should consider recruiting some people from the forums to help with the design.","files":null}]}
