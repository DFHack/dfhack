Actually... wait... I can't find any layer stones on here?  Not gabbro or anything else.  Marble and obsidian are the only one I care much about, though.\n\nWhile I'm at it, I might as well toss in a feature request.  It would be lovely if you could separate the output of dfprospector a little, so that there are categories.  In other words, make the output look something like:\n\n**\\* GEMS ***\nRUBY: 20\nDIAMOND: 25\n\n**\\* NON-ORE ECONOMIC STONES ***\nCALCITE: 1234\nMARBLE:  2456\nOBSIDIAN:  2345\nGYPSUM:  23456\nBITUMINOUS_COAL:  1345\n\n**\\* METAL ORES ***\nNATIVE_SILVER:  1234\nMALACHITE:  2345\nRAW_ADAMANTINE: 7\n\n**\\* ROCKS ***\nORPIMENT:  1234\nSLADE:  12345\nMICROLINE:  9999999999\n\nLink to original post: http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=58809.msg1835831","files":null}]}
