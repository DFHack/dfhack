Possibly related to #500 clickable menus?  There would be an awkward level of re-implementation, but given the possibilities of rearranging things _ala_ the old menu improvement suggestions it could be worth it for a keen modder.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e6d3dafe479ac56fd29593e66f6fd7f028b46105"},"timestamp":1462758855,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzc2MTEwNg==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/919#issuecomment-217761106"},"message":"Yeah, I don't think it would be altogether that useful for replacing the functionality of existing menus. For that, I'd use a transparent viewscreen with its onInput(keys) set to recognize certain areas (which would probably need to be set every onResize(w,h), but that's fine). It's mostly just for DFHack dialogs. I could see a lot of the gui scripts be improved by it, though.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1462843887,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NjU1MTY4MzU0"},"status":2}]}
