Notes by PeridexisErrant, on the needs_porting scripts and plugins:

I've deleted "reveal", "lair", and "dfstatus" - they've been replaced by other more recent versions. (I added the dfstatus script).
Also deleted "digger", less useful than "digger2" and generally replaced by autochop.  "digger2" is replaced by digfort.
And now "veinswap"; replaced by "changevein".


Need confirmation that they're obsolete before deleting (notes below):  
attachtest.py, dfbauxtite.cpp, digpattern.cpp, drawtile.cpp, fix-3708.cpp, treedump.py, and veinlook.cpp

To port:  
copypaste.cpp, hellhole.cpp, hotkeynotedump.py, itemdesignator.cpp (partial), position.py



All undeleted plugins: 

attachtest.py
- checks if dfhack is working with DF (i think)
- definitely replaced on windows, pretty sure also on other platforms

copypaste.cpp
- a proof-of-concept plugin to allow copy-pasting in DF
- if I read it right, it does both terrain and buildings/constructions
- would be awesome if someone ported it!

creaturemanager.cpp
- Display creatures; modify skills and labors of creatures; kill creatures; etc
- looks pretty impressive if incomplete (at 1500 lines I only looked over the comments)
- could maybe do with porting, but it's unfinished and I suspect that most functions are available elsewhere

dfbauxtite.cpp 
- as far as I can tell, this plugin changes the material of all mechanisms (printed string 'mechanisms', class 'item_trapparts') to Bauxtite; presumably from when this was the only magma-safe stone.  
- I don't know of a newer alternative, but it's not really neccessary anymore

digpattern.cpp
- I think all this one does is allow multi-z designations - no longer required.

drawtile.cpp
- draws changes to tiles
- I think this is replaced by tiletypes, but not sure

fix-3708.cpp
- fixes an issue with ghosts you can't engrave a slab for; some bad side-effects
- replaced by "tweak clear-missing" or "tweak clear-ghostly"? (I'm pretty sure it is, but not certain)

hellhole.cpp
- digs a hole to HFS instantly
- no known equivilant, needs porting

hotkeynotedump.py
- outputs a list of hotkeys with names
- less useful with propper dfhack keybindings available, but still useful
- trivial to redo in lua (it's 20 lines, could be 10)

incrementalsearch.cpp
- linux-only memory voodoo; leaving this alone

itemdesignator.cpp
- applies flags to categories of items (eg item_microcline; forbid/dump/melt/on fire)
- appart from fire, replaced by Falconne's enhanced stocks screen
- port the fire part?

position.py
- prints information about time (year/month/day/tick) and place (embark location/cursor pos) and window size
- the wider context can be written to gamelog on world load by "log-region.lua"; this doesn't seem to be included yet

SegementedFinder.h
- no idea what's happening here

treedump.py
- looks like it outputs a list of trees in a given volume
- overlaps with 'prospect' and 'autochop'; probably does not need porting

veinlook.cpp
- I'm not sure what this does that "digv" and "reveal" don't but there must be something since it was around at the same time as reveal.
