The uniform assignment is one of the most difficult aspects of the game and I always want make themed squads, like the Night Watchmen from Game of Thrones or similar but I don't because having to redo it every time is an incredibly daunting task. This would also allow a more gentle learning curve for newbies because they could download a file with a couple of tried and true squad setups so they don't deal with ammo mixup errors or the many other challenges.\n\nThis could potentially cover military settings (eg patrol/training timing, etc) too.  The implementation may be linked to #567.","files":null}]}
