probe
=====

This plugin provides multiple commands that print low-level properties of the
selected objects.

* ``probe``: prints some properties of the tile selected with :kbd:`k`. Some of
  these properties can be passed into `tiletypes`.
* ``cprobe``: prints some properties of the unit selected with :kbd:`v`, as well
  as the IDs of any worn items. `gui/gm-unit` and `gui/gm-editor` are more
  complete in-game alternatives.
* ``bprobe``: prints some properties of the building selected with :kbd:`q` or
  :kbd:`t`. `gui/gm-editor` is a more complete in-game alternative.
