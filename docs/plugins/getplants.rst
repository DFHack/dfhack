.. note::

    DF is capable of determining that a shrub has already been picked, leaving
    an unusable structure part behind. This plugin does not perform such a check
    (as the location of the required information has not yet been identified).
    This leads to some shrubs being designated when they shouldn't be, causing a
    plant gatherer to walk there and do nothing (except clearing the
    designation). See :issue:`1479` for details.
