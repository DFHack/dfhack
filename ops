Some examples:\n- The `b`uilding menu (and its submenus) can contain multiple pages, depending on the window size. The choices are easy to access under `ui_sidebar_menus.building`, but the on-screen positions of each menu item are not.\n- The burrows menu is accessible under `ui.burrows`, but is also paginated (and a slightly different size than the building menu)\n- Items displayed with loo`k` are accessible under `ui_look_list.items`, but are complicated to access due to the various types of items that can be listed (not all of which are able to be selected). In addition, this menu is paginated using yet another page length, and there is no way to determine the on-screen position of each item without calculating on the page length (which could change at any time, without warning).\n\nAlso, there are a number of menus that are already mouse-enabled:\n- `d`esignations (excluding submenus)\n- `n`obles (including submenus)\n\nIf Toady were to add mouse support to more menus without warning, or change existing menus at all, the results would be unpredictable and almost certainly more confusing than simply using keyboard shortcuts.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"be523fe0f95fc478bda36c722e6f106f8f7a41b5"},"timestamp":1422477411,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyNjM2NDE4Nw=="},"added":["idea"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"be523fe0f95fc478bda36c722e6f106f8f7a41b5"},"timestamp":1422477578,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxOTExMzk0","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/500#issuecomment-71911394"},"message":"Maybe if we make it read the text on the screen, so if you click on \"t: Chop Down Trees\" it simulates the user typing the \"t\" character, and if they click on \"Armor Stand        (a)\" then it simulates typing the \"a\" character.
