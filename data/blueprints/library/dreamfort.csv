#notes label(help) run me for the dreamfort walkthrough
Welcome to the Dreamfort Walkthrough!
"It can be difficult to apply a set of blueprints that you did not write yourself. This walkthrough will guide you through the high-level steps of building Dreamfort. Run the /checklist blueprint for a compact list of all commands you need to run, in order. Each level has its own mini-walkthrough with details on *when* to run each command."
""
"The final fort will have a walled-in area on the surface for livestock, trading, surface farming, and military. One z-level down is the farming level, with related workshops and vents up to the surface for miasma control. The farming level also has a miniature dining hall and dormitory for use until you get the services and housing levels set up."
""
"Beyond those two, the other layers can be built in any order, at any z-level, according to your preference and the layout peculiarities of your embark site:"
"- The industry level has a compact, but complete set of workshops and stockpiles (minus what is already provided on the farming level)."
"- The services level has dining, hospital, barracks, and justice services, plus a well system. Services is 4 z-levels deep."
"- The guildhall level has many empty rooms for building libraries, temples, and guildhalls."
- The suites level has fancy rooms for your nobles.
- The apartments levels have small but well-furnished bedrooms for your other dwarves.
""
"Run each level's ""help"" blueprint (e.g. /surface_help) for more details."
""
"Dreamfort has a central stairs-based design. For all Dreamfort levels, place the cursor on the center tile of the 3x3 stairs area when you apply the blueprints. The first surface blueprint will designate a column of stairs that you can use as a guide. If you need to extend the stairs down further to lower levels, run ""quickfort run library/dreamfort.csv -n /central_stairs"" with the cursor on the z-level below the lowest current stairs."
""
"Dreamfort blueprints take care of everything to get the fort up and running. You don't need to clear any extra trees or create any extra buildings/stockpiles (though of course you are free to do so). Blueprints that do require manual steps (like 'assign minecart to hauling route') will leave a message telling you so when you run them. Blueprints will also leave messages with hints when you might want to run ""quickfort orders"" to start manufacturing needed items, like blocks or tables. Make sure you appoint a manager to handle all the incoming work orders!"
""
"Dreamfort works best at an embark site that is flat and has at least one soil layer. New players should also avoid aquifers if they are not prepared to deal with them. Bring picks for mining, an axe for woodcutting, and an anvil for a forge. Bring a few blocks to speed up initial workshop construction as well."
""
"Other DFHack scripts and plugins also work very well with Dreamfort, in particular autofarm, automelt, autonestbox, burial, seedwatch, tailor, and, of course, buildingplan. You can download an onMapLoad.init file that configures all these plugins here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16JX21nSe0_t84BgoL7DJX1OVD2E6pJgH"
Put that file in your Dwarf Fortress directory -- the same directory that has dfhack.init.
""
"Once you have your starting workshops up and running, you might want to configure buildingplan (in its global settings, accessible from any building placement screen, e.g.: b-a-G) to only use blocks for constructions so it won't use your precious wood, boulders, and bars to build floors and walls. If you bring at least 4 blocks with you on embark, you can even set this in your onMapLoad.init file like this:"
on-new-fortress buildingplan set boulders false; buildingplan set logs false
""
"Directly after embark, apply /surface1 on the surface (see /surface_help for how to select a good spot) and /industry1 in a rock layer at least two z-levels underground (the z-level immediately below the surface is reserved for the farming level). The walkthroughs for those levels will guide you. Once you channel out the miasma vents and clear the trees on the surface, you can start the farming sequence on the z-level below the surface with /farming1. You should wait to start farming unitl after you clear the trees because if you clear trees later over a hollow underground, you'll be left with holes in the surface where the trunks were. You can start the services, guildhall, suites, and apartments sequences as your fort needs those levels."

Here is the recommended order for Dreamfort commands. You can copy/paste the quickfort commands directly into the DFHack terminal. See the level walkthroughs for context and details. Also remember to read the messages the blueprints print out after you run them so you don't miss any important manual steps.

All other labors until you can assign them to a migrant

"The most time-comsuming tasks in early Dreamfort are: mining, chopping down trees, and making blocks. Starting with at least two miners, two woodcutters (assuming your embark has trees), and two masons is essential to keeping the fort from stalling. Note you may have to turn off all other labors for your wood cutters to get them focused on wood cutting when there are trees to clear before you can run the next surface blueprint."
"Moreover, it is important to always have one more mason than you have Mason's Workshops so other buildings that require masonry can get built (like bridges). Give the masons Beekeeping for the same reason -- it is a low-priority task, but it's important to have someone free to do it since otherwise the surface set of blueprints can stall."

We suggest bringing at least:
2 picks,for the two miners
2 battleaxes,for the two woodcutters
1 anvil,for the forge
7 blocks,for starting workshops and the temporary trade depot. necessary if you have buildingplan configured for blocks only.
many boulders,for quickly turning into more blocks. blocks are the limiting factor in the early stages.
12 cloth,"to make into rope for traction benches and the jail cells. you could try thread, but that tends to get eaten by the hospital"
food and seeds,as per usual
dogs and cats,for protection and vermin control
turkeys,for eggs and leather
#notes label(surface_help)
Sets up a protected entrance to your fort in a flat area on the surface.
""
Features:
- A starting set of workshops and stockpiles (which you can later remove once you establish your permanent workshops and storage)
- Protected trade depot
"- Walls, roof, and lever-controlled gates for security"
- Trap-filled hallways for invaders
- Optional barracks and extended trap hallways (for extra security)
- Livestock grazing area with nestbox zones and beehives
- A grid of 1x1 farm plots (meant to be managed with DFHack autofarm)
- Miasma vent covers for the farming level that is intended to be built in the layer directly beneath the surface
""
Manual steps you have to take:
- Assign grazing livestock to the large pasture and dogs to the pasture over the central stairs (DFHack's autonestbox can manage the nestbox zones)
- Connect levers to the gates that match the names of the levers
""
Be sure to choose an embark site that has an area flat enough to use these blueprints!
""
Surface Walkthrough:
"1) Choose a center tile for your central fortress stairs. The terrain around that tile should be perfectly flat. Trees are ok, but no slopes, rivers, or lakes. To be sure that the tile you've chosen is in a good spot, set the cursor over that tile and run ""quickfort run library/dreamfort.csv -n /perimeter"". This will show you the eventual boundaries of the fort. Some wall segments might be missing due to existing trees, but that's ok. Make sure the area within the exterior wall is flat. Run ""quickfort undo library/dreamfort.csv -n /perimeter"" to clean up."
""
"2) With the cursor on the chosen tile, run /surface1 to clear surrounding trees and set up your pastures. Deconstruct your wagon to get it out of the way of our upcoming walls and floors. Remember to assign your dogs to the pasture around the staircase and your grazing animals to the large pasture. You can let your cats roam free. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /surface3 to get a head start in manufacturing."
""
"3) Once the marked trees have been cleared, run /surface2 to set up starting workshops/stockpiles, channel out the miasma vents for the farming level, and start clearing trees from a larger area. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /surface3. Make sure you have appointed a manager so the orders get fulfilled! If you haven't done it already, now is a good time to configure buildingplan to only build buildings with blocks, not logs or raw boulders. Do this by entering buildingplan's global configuration (""baG"") and ensuring the only generic building material allowed is ""blocks""."
""
"4) Once the channels are dug out and the trees are cleared, start the farming level one z-level down. Once you have run /farming2, come back to the surface and run /surface3 to cover the vents and build an enclosure around your central stairs. Although the vents will be covered with flooring, they will still work to prevent miasma on the farming level."
""
"5) Once all walls and floors have been constructed around the stairwell, run /surface4 to build floors and walls to support upcoming buildings and furniture. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /surface4."
""
"6) Once walls and floors have been constructed (including the small roof segment one z-level up over the barracks), run /surface5 to build furniture, gates, and the permanent trade depot. Remember to deconstruct the temporary trade depot once nobody is using it. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /surface5."
""
"7) Once at least the beehives and weapon rack are built, run /surface6 to configure the rooms and build the remaining walls and floors. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /surface6."
""
"8) Once you have enough dwarves to do a lot of building without starving other important tasks, run /surface7 to build the roof. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /surface7."
""
"9) For extra security, you can run /surface8 any time after /surface7 to extend the trap corridors. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /surface8."
""
"10) Once your industry and farming levels are set up and running, you can disassemble the surface workshops and remove the surface stockpiles. Disassembling a workshop scatters the items stored within it and cancels any pending jobs that happen to use those items. In order to avoid job cancellations, first set the surface workshops to not accept general work orders. Do this by entering query mode (""q""), selecting a workshop, entering the workshop profile (""P""), moving to work orders (right arrow), and hitting Enter. Then enter view mode (""t"") and check to see if any items in a workshop are marked with ""TSK"". Once no items in the workshop have that marker, you are free to disassemble that workshop."

#notes label(farming_help)
"Sets up farming, food storage, and related industries. Also provides post-embark necessities that can later be disassembed."
""
Features:
- Pairs with the surface blueprints to provide miasma vents
- Farm plots (intended to be managed by DFHack autofarm)
- Plentiful food storage
- Refuse/corpse quantum stockpile
- Small dormitory and dining room for post-embark needs
- Small offices for your manager and bookkeeper
""
Workshops:
- Kitchen
- Brewery
- Butcher
- Fishery
- Tannery
- Farmer's Workshop
- Quern
- Screw Press
""
Manual steps you have to take:
- Assign the lower office to your manager and the upper office to your bookkeeper (if different from your manager)
- Assign a minecart to your refuse quantum stockpile hauling route
"- If the industry level is already built, configure the jugs, pots, and bags stockpiles to take from the ""Goods"" quantum stockpile on the industry level"
""
Farming Walkthough:
"1) Wait until you have channeled the miasma vents and cleared trees on the surface before digging out the farming level on the z-level below the surface, otherwise you will end up with extra ramps on the farming level and unprotected holes through the surface when you later chop down trees growing above empty space."
""
"2) Start digging with /farming1 and get started on manufacturing furniture by running ""quickfort orders"" on /farming2 and /farming3."
""
"3) Once the level is dug out, run /farming2 to build workshops, stockpiles, and the furniture we need to declare the rooms. Remember to assign a minecart to the newly-designated quantum refuse dump. There are also jugs, pots, and bags stockpiles on this level that should be configured to ""take"" from the industry level stockpiles once we get the industry level built."
""
"4) When the furniture is in place, run /farming3 to designate your starter dining room and dormitory and build the farm plots and remaining furniture. The blueprint also attempts to assign the lower office to your manager, but double-check this assignment in case your dwarves are in an unexpected order."
""
"5) Once your fort has enough free time to build the remaining doors, run /farming4. This will also enable seasonal fertilization for your farm plots. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /farming4."
""
"6) You can disassemble the dining room and dormitory once the services and apartments levels are up and running, if you like."
"#dig label(farming1) start(16; 18; central stairs) message(This would be a good time to queue up manager orders for /farming2. Once the area is dug out, continue with /farming2.)"
# this level is dug at priority 2 since it is dug in soil. it's worth the miner's time to stop digging the industry level and
# quickly dig out this one.

#notes label(industry_help)
Sets up workshops for all non-farming industries
""
Features:
- Quantum stockpiles for infinite storage
- Space-efficient layout for all workshops
with separate stockpiles for:
- A reserve of uncut gems for strange moods that the jeweler's workshop cannot take from
- Steel bars and coal so you can see at a glance if you're low on either
- Items that cannot be quantum stockpiled (e.g. lye and sand bags)
- Meltable weapons and armor
""
Workshops:
- 3x Mason
- 1x Craftsdwarf
- 1x Jeweler
- 1x Mechanic
- 4x Smelter
- 1x Forge
- 1x Glassmaker
- 1x Kiln
- 4x Wood furnace
- 1x Ashery
- 1x Soap maker
- 1x Carpenter
- 1x Siege workshop
- 1x Bowyer
- 1x Dyer
- 1x Loom
- 1x Clothier
""
""
Manual steps you have to take:
- Assign minecarts to your quantum stockpile hauling routes
"- Give from the ""Goods"" quantum stockpile to the jugs, pots, and bags stockpiles on the farming level"
"- If desired, set the stockpiles in the bottom right to auto-melt. This results in melting all weapons and armor that are not masterwork steel. This is great for upgrading your military, but it takes a *lot* of fuel. If you enable this, be sure you're in a heavily forested area, enable auto-chop, and keep your coal stocks high."
- Download automation.json from https://drive.google.com/file/d/17WcN5mK-rnADOm2B_JFpPnByYgkYjxhb/view and put it in your dfhack-config/orders/ directory.
""
Industry Walkthrough:
"1) You can start digging out /industry1 immediately after embark. It is best to choose a stone layer at least two layers underground so the boulders can be used by your starting workshops. Note that even if you dig the services level immediately below this one, there is space to route magma underneath your furnaces so you can replace the furnaces on this level with magma-powered equivalents."
""
"2) Queue up manufacturing by running ""quickfort orders"" on /industry2. If you brought an anvil, feel free to remove the anvil work order from the manager orders screen."
""
"3) Once the area is dug out, run /industry2. Remember to assign minecarts to to your quantum stockpile hauling routes, and if the farming level is already built, give from the ""Goods"" quantum stockpile to the jugs, pots, and bags stockpiles on the farming level."
""
"4) If you want to automatically melt goblinite and other low-quality weapons and armor, mark the south-east stockpiles for auto-melt."
""
"5) Run ""orders import automation"" to use the provided automation.json to take care of your fort's basic needs, such as food, booze, military supplies, and raw material processing. If you get job cancelation spam about not being able to make soap, manually queue up a few ""Make lye"" jobs at your ashery. That should get the soap-making jobs back on track."
""
"6) You'll need more than 2 Mason's Workshops to keep up with the orders. When you have more masons, make more Mason's Workshops as needed."
"#dig label(industry1) start(18; 18; central stairs) message(This would be a good time to queue manager orders for /industry2. Once the area is dug out, continue with /industry2.)"

#notes label(services_help)
"Sets up public services (dining, hospital, etc.)"
""
Features:
- Spacious dining room (also usable as a tavern)
- Prepared food and drink stockpiles
- Well cistern system (bring your own water)
- Four well-appointed jail cells
- Hospital with a well for washing
- Garbage dump
""
Manual steps you have to take:
"- If you want to declare the dining room as a tavern, the bedrooms at the top can be assigned to the tavern as rented rooms."
"- Fill the cisterns with water, either with a bucket brigade or by plumbing flowing water. Fill so that there are two z-levels of 7-depth water to prevent muddiness. If you want to fill with buckets, designate a pond zone on the level below the main floor. If you feel adventurous and are experienced with water pressure, you can instead route (depressurized!) water to the second-to-bottom level (the one above the up staircases)."
""
Services Walkthough:
1) Start this level before your fort grows beyond around 50 dwarves so everyone has a place to eat.
""
"2) Start digging with /services1. Note that this digs out the main level and three levels below for the well plumbing. Start manufacturing with ""quickfort orders"" on /services2."
""
"3) Once the area is dug out, set up important furniture, stockpiles, hospital zone and garbage dump zone with /services2."
""
"4) When the table and chair have been placed in the dining room and the weapon rack and archery targets have been constructed in the barracks, run /services3 to build the rest of the furniture and configure your dining room and barracks. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /services3."
""
5) Fill the wells with either bucket brigades or by carefully routing flowing water.
""
"6) When your fort is mature enough to need jail cells, run /services4 to set those up. You also get some decorative statues to increase the value of your dining hall. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /services4."
"#dig label(services1) start(23; 22; central stairs) message(This would be a good time to queue manager orders for /services2 and /services3. Once the area is dug out, continue with /services2.)"

#notes label(beds_help)
Suites for nobles and apartments for the teeming masses
""
Features:
- Well-appointed suites to satisfy most nobles
- Apartments with beds and storage to keep dwarves happy
- Apartments also serve as burial chambers since dwarves like looking at coffins
- Meta blueprint included for designating 6 levels of apartments for a full 200+ dwarves
""
Suites Walkthrough:
1) Dig out the suites layer with /suites1.
""
"2) Once the area is dug out, furnish the suites with /suites2. The rooms are left unconfigured so you can assign them to specific nobles. Each room can serve as a bedroom, a dining hall, an office, and/or a tomb. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /suites2."
""
Apartments Walkthrough:
"1) Dig out one layer of apartments with /apartments1, or 6 layers at once (enough for 200 dwarves) with /apartments1_stack."
""
"2) Once a layer is dug out, build beds with /apartments2. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /apartments2."
""
"3) Once the beds are built, configure the rooms and build the remaining furniture with /apartments3. Run ""quickfort orders"" for /apartments3. Once the coffins are all in place, run ""burial -pets"" to set them all to accept burials."
