Maybe other features if modders want them.\n\nOnce this works it would have the advantage that without external tools you could make any language translate into english even if the modder (or Toady) adds new words to a language raw file. Personally I like english-speaking dwarves because their names are easier to remember.\n\nProblems\n- humans don't speak english by in vanilla so I'd have to auto-generate the translations\n- sometimes there are multiple definitions of the same word in english that correspond to different words in a DF language\n- have to re-run it every time you load probably (but that's fine)\n\nSee df.global.world.raws.languages for relevant data / structures.","files":null}]}
