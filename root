I'm on macOS Mojave 10.14.6. The only thing I'd used DFHack for since loading the game previously is 'revflood' as the 'unreveal' command wasn't working after saving and loading with the map revealed.\n\nWhen the crash happened, macOS produced a crash report which I've included.\n[DFHackBugReport.txt](https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/files/4411307/DFHackBugReport.txt)","files":null}]}
