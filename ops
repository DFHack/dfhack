At least, until a configurable minimum number of soap bars are in the stocks/hospitals.\n\nIt would make sense for drinks as well, allowing to cook them when they are abundant, and forbid once the amount goes below a threshold.\n\nAll this (seeds, plants, drinks, tallow) is relatively similar in function, so it could/should be handled by the same plugin. Configuring the threshold(s) could be done with the lua-UI stuff; see workflow, autobutcher etc.","files":null}]}
