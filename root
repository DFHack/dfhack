Make sure DF decompressed into its folders properly.\n\nThis crash repeats on DF 0.34.11 with DFhack 0.34.11_r3 and on DF 0.40.08 with DFhack from master (which, as far as I understand, is 0.40.08_r2). In both combinations DF \u0026 DFhack are installed in the same dir, file data/index is present there too and has non-zero size. Without DFhack, DF starts and works fine in both cases. Following an advice from Google, I tried removing any `~/.dwarffortress` dirs, but it didn't help.\n\nAs an additional information, about a half year ago everything worked just fine, but I don't remember which versions of DF \u0026 DFhack did I use.","files":null}]}
