Cross verified in Dwarf Manipulator.\n\nCurrently, unit.name and the unit's hist_fig name match -for Criminals, Scouts, and other Agents.\n\nI say 'into strong focus' and not more directly state to unilaterally comment it out, as I do not have a historical vampire to crosscheck. I do not know if their unit and hist_fig names match as well.\n\nI've spent waaay too much effort on this [see https://github.com/EldrickWT/eld-dfhack-scripts/blob/master/toomuchidentity.lua in all it's spammy spammy glory.], and I'm starting to just see it on a dart board.
