This seems odd behavior,  I actually had to use script raw\\\u003cfilename\u003e just to get it to target files outside of dwarf fortress... Shouldn't any call to look for scripts to be run as init files,, be looking through the same folders in the same order that it does for init files:\n1.The main DF directory\n2.data/save/world/raw, where world is the current save, and\n3.data/save/world/raw/objects\n\nor is there a special way to call this to make it select the current world save?","files":null}]}
