The interface works flawlessly, but even when furniture (with no filters) becomes available, it does not get placed, as far as I can see.\n\u003e All the furniture is suspended \"Needs furniture hauling\" (which i have plenty of idle dorfs for) and I can't unsuspend them by directly selecting them (it ignores the keypress.) If I try to unsuspend from the job list, the job just gets cancelled completely (presumably because the material is unknown)\n\nReported by srhb on the DFHack channel at around the time of this submission.","files":null}]}
