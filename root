If the save is left to run the crash should occur shortly. The jobs are currently running on three Stonecutter's workshops on Z-level -9, slightly to the left of the Slag pits. If the jobs in either of the active workshops (the top two) are cancelled the crash occurs immediately. If the inactive job is cancelled it does not cause the crash. The workshops are managed via a vanilla DF give command from the Bar/Block stockpile immediately above them and via a DF hack workflow command regulating \"workflow amount BLOCKS//CONCRETE 200\". Removing either or both of those prior to unpausing did not impact the crash.\n\nThis is using dfhack r3 with the addition of falconne's \"Utility Plugins for UI Improvement\" and masterwork v.2h. It appears to be linked to dfhack (if I understand things correctly) because if I launch dwarf fortress using the df script instead of dfhack script (this is on a mac OS 10.8.3) and then cancel the jobs it does not crash and proceeds normally.\n\nThe save is at \nhttp://dffd.wimbli.com/file.php?id=7530","files":null}]}
