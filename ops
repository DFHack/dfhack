I'm really missing prospect and digv.\n\nFollowing the instructions at [http://ghostlords.com/2012/04/dfhack-on-the-mac-1-build-process/]() I managed to get DFHack to compile. It copies the Linux ./dfhack file, which is a minor annoyance. Everything else seems to have built fine for OSX. Using the OSX ./dfhack instead, it loads and DFHack is running, but then DF crashes with a Bus Error when I try to run any commands that actually touch DF.\n\nIt's not hard to see why, since the library/xml/osx/df.globals.xml file is empty. My hopes that the layout would be the same as Linux were dashed when comparing the Dwarf Therapist .ini files for the same version on Linux and OSX. What is involved in acquiring this data on a new platform? Are the instructions or tools to extract it, or can it be based off of DT's files?\n\nI've got a Mac and know my way around Unixy systems, shall we try to get real Mac support in place at last?","files":null}]}
