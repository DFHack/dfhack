End result =\u003e a significantly large quantity of the skin and meat ends up going rotten before it's had a chance to be stored away/processed.\n\nIt would be a nice enhancement to be able to specify an upper limit to the number of animals butchered in a day (e.g. like with manager orders that say \"make 3 items, check conditions daily\" which limits the production of those items to max 3 in a day - you can end up with 0, 1, 2, or 3 completed in any one day with any left over happening the next day/etc, but never more than 3 in a single day), so that sudden \"bursts\" of animals maturing doesn't result in huge bursts of meat/skin being produced that cannot usually be processed in the time available before rotting.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1565474387,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI1NDgzNjQ3NTU="},"added":["idea"],"removed":[]},{"type":2,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1565474393,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MjU0ODM2NDc4MQ=="},"title":"Limiting max slaughters-per-day for autobutcher","was":"Limiting max slaughters-per-day for autobutcher"},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"df7feee793b3a4f60453609739052ef8e882d092"},"timestamp":1577974990,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDIyMTc5Ng==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1450#issuecomment-570221796"},"message":"I've never used autobutcher, but have experienced the same issue when doing it manually. My manual approach is \"pulsed\", i.e. I designate 5-6 creatures for slaughter (low pop fortress), and don't designate a new batch until the butchery has been cleaned out.\nIt may be harder to implement a push-back of that kind, but it takes my fortresses considerably longer than a day to clean out the results of a single slaughtered animal. To make things worse, it seems haulers with both food and refuse hauling jobs prefer to haul off the bones and rotting food rather than saving the fresh one, resulting in a vicious circle when you get out of sync.\nI think you'd still want to slaughter animals in batches, as slaughtering one, cleaning out, slaughtering the next, etc. will lead to the butcher wandering off to do something else between the animals, resulting in a needlessly low efficiency.","files":null}]}
