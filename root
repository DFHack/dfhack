I can usually remember that a command exists, but not its exact name. For example, when trying to remove ramps, some times I'll do `unramp`, `removeramp`, `rampremove`, etc. before I hit on `deramp`. If I'm desperate I'll open a web browser and visit http://dfhack.readthedocs.org/ (which is very nice, BTW, but inconvenient to pull up).\n\nIf this were a typical Linux command, I would use `ls | grep ramp` to filter the listing down by piping it through grep. Obviously that syntax is obtuse for non-nerds, so I'd like to see something more like `search ramp` or maybe just an extension to `ls` as `ls ramp`. Note this wouldn't map exactly to the Linux command for `ls`, which would only list files that _started_ with `ramp`, instead it would include all commands (and their help) that contained that word.\n\nAlso related/useful but a different request is tab-completion over in #696.\n\nI love the work you've done with dfhack, thanks!","files":null}]}
