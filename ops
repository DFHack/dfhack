With the new `blueprint` plugin creating complete QF blueprints, it would be good to have a native way to lay out the generated blueprints in-game.\n\nFor \"place\" mode, all basic stockpiles need to be settable.  Custom stockpiles are not supported, IIRC.  For \"query\" mode, it would be good to support all options - but a majority of cases would be covered by `r+` for making a room.","files":null}]}
