Other benefits would include ease of dumping data in general, and potentially wider adoption of state-dumping options for plugins to enable moving settings to another save.\n\nIf security is a concern, valid file names could be restricted to non-existent `*.txt` files in the DF folder - preserving most common uses, and limiting accidental damage.","files":null}]}
