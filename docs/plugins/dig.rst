Usage
-----

``digv [x] [-p<number>]``
    Designate all of the selected vein for digging.
``digvx [-p<number>]``
    Dig a vein across z-levels, digging stairs as needed. This is an alias for
    ``digv x``.
``digl [x] [undo] [-p<number>]``
    Dig all of the selected layer stone. If ``undo`` is specified, removes the
    designation instead (for if you accidentally set 50 levels at once).
``diglx [-p<number>]``
    Dig layer stone across z-levels, digging stairs as needed. This is an alias
    for ``digl x``.
``digcircle [<diameter>] [<solidity>] [<action>] [<designation>] [-p<number>]``
    Designate circles. The diameter is the number of tiles across the center of
    the circle that you want to dig. See the `digcircle`_ section below for
    options.
``digtype [<designation>] [-p<number>] [--zup|-u] [--zdown|-zu] [--cur-zlevel|-z] [--hidden|-h] [--no-auto|-a]``
    Designate all vein tiles of the same type as the selected tile. See the
    `digtype`_ section below for options.
``digexp [<pattern>] [<filter>] [-p<number>]``
    Designate dig patterns for exploratory mining. See the `digexp`_ section
    below for options.

All commands support specifying the priority of the dig designations with
``-p<number>``, where the number is from 1 to 7. If a priority is not specified,
the priority selected in-game is used as the default.

Examples
--------

``digcircle filled 3 -p2``
    Dig a filled circle with a diameter of 3 tiles at dig priority 2.
``digcircle``
    Do it again (previous parameters are reused).
``expdig diag5 hidden``
    Designate the diagonal 5 pattern over all hidden tiles on the current
    z-level.
``expdig ladder designated``
    Take existing designations on the current z-level and replace them with the
    ladder pattern.
``expdig``
    Do it again (previous parameters are reused).

digcircle
---------

The ``digcircle`` command can accept up to one option of each type below.

Solidity options:

``hollow``
    Designates hollow circles (default).
``filled``
    Designates filled circles.

Action options:

``set``
    Set designation (default).
``unset``
    Unset current designation.
``invert``
    Invert designations already present.

Designation options:

``dig``
    Normal digging designation (default).
``ramp``
    Dig ramps.
``ustair``
    Dig up staircases.
``dstair``
    Dig down staircases.
``xstair``
    Dig up/down staircases.
``chan``
    Dig channels.

After you have set the options, the command called with no options repeats with
the last selected parameters.

digtype
-------

For every tile on the map of the same vein type as the selected tile, this command
designates it to have the same designation as the selected tile. If the selected
tile has no designation, they will be dig designated. By default, only designates
visible tiles, and in the case of dig designation, applies automatic mining to them
(designates uncovered neighbouring tiles of the same type to be dug).

If an argument is given, the designation of the selected tile is ignored, and
all appropriate tiles are set to the specified designation.

Designation options:

``dig``
    Normal digging designation.
``channel``
    Dig channels.
``ramp``
    Dig ramps.
``updown``
    Dig up/down staircases.
``up``
    Dig up staircases.
``down``
    Dig down staircases.
``clear``
    Clear any designations.

Other options:

``--zdown``, ``-d``
    Only designates tiles on the cursor's z-level and below.
``--zup``, ``-u``
    Only designates tiles on the cursor's z-level and above.
``--cur-zlevel``, ``-z``
    Only designates tiles on the same z-level as the cursor.
``--hidden``, ``-h``
    Allows designation of hidden tiles, and picking a hidden tile as the target type.
``--no-auto``, ``-a``
    No automatic mining mode designation - useful if you want to avoid dwarves digging where you don't want them.

digexp
------

This command is for :wiki:`exploratory mining <Exploratory_mining>`.

There are two variables that can be set: pattern and filter.

Patterns:

``diag5``
    Diagonals separated by 5 tiles.
``diag5r``
    The diag5 pattern rotated 90 degrees.
``ladder``
    A 'ladder' pattern.
``ladderr``
    The ladder pattern rotated 90 degrees.
``cross``
    A cross, exactly in the middle of the map.
``clear``
    Just remove all dig designations.

Filters:

``hidden``
    Designate only hidden tiles of z-level (default)
``all``
    Designate the whole z-level.
``designated``
    Take current designation and apply the selected pattern to it.

After you have a pattern set, you can use ``expdig`` to apply it again.

Overlay
-------

This tool also provides two overlays that are managed by the `overlay`
framework. Both have no effect when in graphics mode, but when in ASCII mode,
they display useful highlights that are otherwise missing from the ASCII mode
interface.

The ``dig.asciiwarmdamp`` overlay highlights warm tiles red and damp tiles in
blue. Box selection characters and the keyboard cursor will also
change color as appropriate when over the warm or damp tile.

The ``dig.asciicarve`` overlay highlights tiles that are designated for
smoothing, engraving, track carving, or fortification carving. The designations
blink so you can still see what is underneath them.

Note that due to the limitations of the ASCII mode screen buffer, the
designation highlights may show through other interface elements that overlap
the designated area.
