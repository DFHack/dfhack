Provide certain degree of automation -- loading of fortresses, adventure mode, pushing input.\n\nAlso: forceful Process/Context termination and management of saves.\n\nAnother thing could be the ability to specify the type of Contexts/Processes to prefer. Say, prefer normal Processes over SHM processes. This could be good for debugging, because normal Processes can't make DF segfault from accessing invalid memory.","files":null}]}
