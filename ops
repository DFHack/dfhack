Maybe abstract_building (which doesn't have a name field) changed, since name is at the beginning of a bunch of subclasses. Or it could be an issue with a subclass that does have fields before `name`.\n\u003e \n\u003e @Castaras I think a save would be helpful here.\n\u003e \n\u003e Edit: looks like it's an issue with the base class - some int32_t fields added in 0.42 are actually pointers.\n\nhi im having the same problem andit really frustrates me that i cant know the world im playing at can you please explain the raws that you deleted thank you","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1559272410,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NzU1OTcwNQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1005#issuecomment-497559705"},"message":"What DFHack version are you using?

But that change was made almost 3 years ago, and included in a release not long after, so I'm not sure what you're looking for.","files":null}]}
