If I were to redo it now I would make it so that argument names must start with a letter. That way we'd only need a single backslash per escape instead of needing one to indicate that it's an argument name not an argument value for the previous arg and one to escape the special argument substitution function.\n\nIdeally the new system should be backwards-compatible with the old one. Maybe something other than backslashes? `!` maybe?","files":null}]}
