This is also happening to me with the windows x64 version. I also think it's an issue with the DFHack's search, because as soon as q is pressed (the hotkey for search) and anything is typed, the full selection list disappears.\n\nEdit: This might be helpful to Caeboox2 (although maybe this is a bug nonetheless). I was trying to create an uniform before having formed any squad and that produced the previously described behaviour. If, instead, a squad is already created, the equipment screen works as usual.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1513551073,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MjI5MjQzMw==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1199#issuecomment-352292433"},"message":"Okay, I'm not seeing anything from the search plugin at all on this screen. Upon further investigation, the search plugin is only supposed to be enabled in the \"positions\" tab, probably for exactly this reason, but the screen (viewscreen_layer_militaryst) is misaligned, so the \"page\" field is not right. I'm guessing it's managing to read \"0\" from that field and interpreting that as the \"positions\" tab for both of you, and displaying the search option.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1513551080,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEzOTEyNDA1MzE="},"added":["structures"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"5221f59e75ea9db114593bbdfb180b7354aef9ed"},"timestamp":1513555706,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MjI5NzM4NA==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1199#issuecomment-352297384"},"message":"Should be fixed with DFHack/df-structures@e536d27","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"b271b580f1fe6dcc65f2a52a794f2cb5313cb9a9"},"timestamp":1513607376,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MjQ0MDkyMQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1199#issuecomment-352440921"},"message":"Thanks, guys.
