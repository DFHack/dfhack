I just updated the script to fix a few issues I found after further testing and use on my part.  I could put in an argument for printing so that the script is silent by default, and maybe one for use on player dwarves.  As it seems that there are a few issues with praying for dwarves that have multiple deities, see: http://mail.bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=9324\nThat bug is fixed in later versions apparently, while I'm still running 0.42.03 myself.  Ideally I would like to make a script that removes needs from units that cannot fulfill them due to lacking speech, but I don't currently know if that's possible.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1493411147,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEwNjI3NjE1NzI="},"added":["new tool"],"removed":[]}]}
