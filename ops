They should be checked carefully, and combined where possible.\n- [ ] `modtools/reaction-trigger-transition` was only ever meant to be temporary, and should simply be removed.\n- [ ] `modtools/equip-item` was intended to replace the `forceequip` plugin.  This should be checked, and the plugin removed.\n- [ ] `gui/hack-wish` is an alias for `gui/create-item`, and should be removed - modders have had plenty of time to transition here too.\n- [ ] `modtools/create-item` can handle everything the `createitem` plugin can, though it must be invoked twice for a left/right pair of gloves.  Once this is added to the script, the plugin should be removed.\n\nThis issue replaces #735, with tighter scope.","files":null}]}
