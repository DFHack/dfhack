The manipulator could background color each labor as good/ok/bad depending on the dwarfs attributes which are relevant to each labor. This would change dwarf labor assignment for new immigrants into a pleasant little visual game, instead of the current difficult puzzle.\n\nIt might not be very difficult to add. The manipulator columns already handle a different background color for the non-job columns. The labor grid display seems to be made around here `manipulator.cpp:1985` where it already has access to each dwarfs stats including emotions and attributes.","files":null}]}
