Travis should test that (a) each keybinding is documented, and (b) that each documented keybinding exists.\n\nIt would be fairly easy to enforce an ugly and labor-intensive version via text-matching.  However I'd prefer to use a custom Sphinx directive (or role), which would enable some nice formatting and automatically stay up-to-date with the init file.","files":null}]}
