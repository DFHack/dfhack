I originally referred to the non existent file, and then found the directory was missing as well, so it should have said \"the Visual Studio 14.0 directory doesn't contain the VC directory\". The only directory present in 14.0 is XML.\nI've tried your proposed version as well, and it fails to find the bat file. As mentioned, I can work around it with some transpiration, but I thought others may be subjected to it as well (I did work around it a couple of months ago when testing my plugin, but didn't write an issue at that time).","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"df7feee793b3a4f60453609739052ef8e882d092"},"timestamp":1511879489,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTM2MTQ3NDY2Ng=="},"status":2},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1511880026,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQxMzYxNDk0Njgx"},"status":1},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"df7feee793b3a4f60453609739052ef8e882d092"},"timestamp":1511881998,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzU1NDMwNQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1190#issuecomment-347554305"},"message":"Looks like you nailed it directly. The link isn't too hard to understand (despite the incorrect double negations). Given both that it worked for 32 bit and that I did a FULL install after some other things were missing, it never occurred to me that required things would be left out.\n(And I still haven't learned that Close and Comment does NOT mean \"close this window and post the comment\").\nThere's something wrong with my computer, it seems. I've manually installed the extra package 3 times, only to find nothing has been added and the installation checkbox is unchecked. Looks lime lengthy maintenance is required, as it seem to take forever to run the \"repair\" option.\n\nEdit:\nAfter 2 hours of \"repairing\" the installer comes back with \"Sorry Dave, but I can't do that\", claiming there's a pre existing installation, and something is wrong: most of it is on the C drive, while what looks like a more complete 14.0 tree is on the D drive with only a vestigal one on the C drive. I've installed it twice: first the standard and then the complete package. Did I realize I ran out of space on the OS disk in between the installs? It's possible (it was 2-3 months ago).\nAnyway, a request: See if it's possible to make the win 64 bat files able to detect which disk Visual Studio is installed on to make a call to the correct drive. I've manually changed mine, so once a two hour uninstall followed by a two hour install is performed I should be able to see if that works.\n\nEdit2: Contact with Microsoft and the application of a \"nuke everything installed with this\" script allowed installation, and things work, even though installation resulted in a warning about a conflict.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"df7feee793b3a4f60453609739052ef8e882d092"},"timestamp":1512731462,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTM3ODY0NzQ1Nw=="},"status":2}]}
