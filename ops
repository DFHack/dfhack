This is something specific to our C++\u003c\u003eLua layer - printing a pointer to a DF object involves looking up its type, which in the case of some classes (like `item` and its subclasses) involves looking up the object's RTTI information, which requires dereferencing the pointer and will crash if the pointer is invalid.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"c8bdff833a0d45e9a1c07751adfd0917db2f83d1"},"timestamp":1603361182,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNDM4NDU2OA==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1678#issuecomment-714384568"},"message":"The save: https://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=15264\nI found something interesting.\nIt looks like it is related to caravan leaving the area.
