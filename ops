It predates onLoad.init files, anyway (and those were originally just in the main DF folder). I doubt anyone is relying on the current behavior, though, so it's probably fine to change.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1494558361,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDk3MjExNA==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1090#issuecomment-300972114"},"message":"Never mind, these scripts don't really keep track of their own directory.
