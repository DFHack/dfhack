Sorry for using a github issue, but it seemed like the easiest way to communicate.\n\nI'm experimenting with building a program that communicates with DFHack using node. I saw that grpc is currently being used for this purpose. For that, I used [this tutorial](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/node/basics/). Loading the .proto files worked fine, however from there I got stuck. The tutorial explains that to create a client, you have to \"attach\" to one of the service definitions in the proto file. But as far as I can tell, the proto files in DFHack don't define any services at all. Rather, all the function signatures seem to be only available as comments. How would I go about actually calling these functions from node grpc?","files":null}]}
