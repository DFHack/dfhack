The direction attributes appears to be stubbed out in the TileTypes code, and /df-structures.xml seems to document all the necessary direction flags,  but in the wall and track implementations of TileTypes, the comments basically say \"just use non-direction variant\" and then skips over any direction attribute processing. \nAm I missing something?  I'd like to have the feature to create correctly directioned walls and tracks, so I'm considering creating a fork to implement it by adding additional processing under the \"special\" option - unless there's a reason it was left out.","files":null}]}
