The problem was that when the old ones were hanging around 0x17000 and then 0x35000, the current version has them closer to 0x2A000 and 0x58000. All the relative-distance CALL and JMP instructions needed new values to account for the much wider and inconsistent gaps between the addresses. One JMP that was pointing to some unmentioned section of original code had to be tracked down too. Thank goodness it was a fairly unique instance of code that showed up quickly.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"210839a1d5a55b2d91ee1a7b364dd95178d4bd08"},"timestamp":1430500590,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk4MTgwNDA2","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/546#issuecomment-98180406"},"message":"So, how can I use these patches now?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"78ba4f5d813d93eaa6e692a2e66d44d9e98552ad"},"timestamp":1430501378,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk4MTgzMTk5","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/546#issuecomment-98183199"},"message":"Well, the fact of the matter is that I failed to bring the armorstand-capacity patch back online. I got a grip on where the important bits were, but couldn't wrangle the assembly instructions to point at the moved empty space. My notes are such a mess that I'd probably have to retrace my steps to say where they were.\n\nI have a functioning version of the critical weapon rack fix for Windows, however. I haven't gotten around to making a pull request, what with the fact that the military currently doesn't feel like doing anything besides training on their days off and the deprecation of binary patches as a thing, but here it is anyway.\nhttp://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=zdAbuVWS\n\nRemember how binary patches worked?
