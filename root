It seems to work, so I will be living with it from now on. If there is approval, I can make a pull request, but I will need some mentorship on code quality and cross platform support, since I have very little C++ skill.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/compare/develop...kindaro:feature-manipulator-remove-template?expand=1","files":null}]}
