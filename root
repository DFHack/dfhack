Change the marker style for Lua to avoid the use of `=begin` and `=end`.  This will facilitate use of the same string, without any duplication, in online docs, as a top-of-file explanation, and as the help text in the DFHack terminal.\n2. Consequential changes, eg updating docs and example scripts, merging any separate helpstrings with docstrings as appropriate, etc.\n\nMay cause minor conflict with #722 depending on implementation timing.\n\nRequires #723, as I'm not going to do separate pull requests against all the script subrepos and deal with the pain of it not being synced again!","files":null}]}
