add-spatter
===========
This plugin makes reactions with names starting with ``SPATTER_ADD_``
produce contaminants on the items instead of improvements.  The plugin is
intended to give some use to all those poisons that can be bought from caravans,
so they're immune to being washed away by water or destroyed by `clean`.
