I cam across an interesting thing.  generally I just abandon and then reembark on the same location with a new race.  well sometimes areas that have previously been seen will refuse to reveal, so I use revflood.   Well this is the first time I was doing this on an abandoned world generated fort (I usually just pick a suitable area to test everything I want to test and dig a quick hole in the ground, speed test, and quit...).\n\nwell I'm not sure if its because world generated stairs are different from normal made stairs, but revflood would reveal the entire floor up to a stairway, then refuse to reveal the floor below.  I just went to the stair dropped (or rose) a Z and revflood again to get the next floor, but I've not had it do that to me before.  It was as if revflood doesn't see the stairway as a open passage way.\n\nanyways, I just wanted to drop the note here.  I've had revflood reveal through stairs with no problem before, this is the first time I had it refuse to show through a stairwell, wondered if anyone else had such an issue?","files":null}]}
