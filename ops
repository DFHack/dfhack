IIRC it's also possible for someone really into world building to use TWBT and repurpose otherwise graphical-only indices in the tileset for other ligatures or accents in a `-text` tileset.\n\nMy initial attempt at this replaces characters as per my best guess coming from looking at the curses tileset, but given the possibility of customization and possible issues with translations to other languages I'm leaning towards having a configuration file approach that can defaulted to an English version based on my best guesses.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1600917860,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5ODA4ODMwNQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1598#issuecomment-698088305"},"message":"Oh, I hadn't even thought of Æ/æ, but I suppose converting it to \"AE\" for comparison purposes is fine. I don't see any other characters on the [wiki](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Character_table) that this would apply to.\n\nAs for mods: DF uses an existing standard code page (CP437), where characters and symbols are already defined. If mods *add* non-ASCII alphabetic characters (or change existing ones), my opinion is that they're asking for trouble and we don't need to spend too much time supporting that. (As an extreme example, a mod that swaps the tiles for 'a' (97) and 'b' (98) would already break a variety of text-based filters, including in vanilla DF.) My impression is that most mods that don't strictly follow CP437 are removing alphabetic characters, so that would hopefully not be an issue. It could be worth making configurable down the road, and may be more necessary if DF supports more tiles in the next release, but I wouldn't spend too much time on that now.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"e80fd90b3ba2a13a3e21178b0ab7750a11671c50"},"timestamp":1600923623,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5ODExMjk2Nw==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/1598#issuecomment-698112967"},"message":"Ah perfect, I was looking for a table like that.
