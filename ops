There's a corresponding directory and file in 12.0, but changing the script to use that one caused another error further down the line.\nIn contrast, the first line of the 32 bit scripts is:\n\"call \"%VS140COMNTOOLS%vsvars32.bat\", and those scripts do work.\n\nThe underlying compilation works both for the 64 and 32 bit versions when done from within Visual Studio, but then the copying to the target DF directories becomes a manual task (or I've failed to figure out how to make Visual Studio do it).\n\nDFHack and Visual Studio was downloaded as per the instructions on how to contribute.","files":null}]}
