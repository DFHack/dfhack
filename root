Is it possible to make an additional embark tweak? In particular, allowing 1x1 forts through DFhack.\n\u003e \n\u003e I have done this through memory hacking, but it becomes tedious because the addresses change on each embark. To my knowledge there exist four embark coordinates, two for both defining corners. They can be set to make the embark 1x1, or even lower, but then the embark field disappears and I have not tried to embark on that. The values are absolute, that is, instead of saying \"x, y, region 12\" it is \"x, y, starting from the whole map's corner\". I was often required to change to 8 byte searches to find these numbers, depending how large the map is. I keep forgetting which map corner is (0,0), upper left or lower left. The coordinates are simple to find, just enlarge/reduce the embark size in one direction, and coordinates change by a simple amount of 1 per size step.\n\u003e \n\u003e Of course that the most convenient option would be to simply allow 1x1 embarks ingame, but barring that, a commandline order would be very welcome as well.\n\u003e \n\u003e If you're read this far, thank you! I wont demand a reply XD but without one I'll forever wonder whether you received this or not.\n\u003e \n\u003e ~Elle~\n\nObviously a version of nano embark.","files":null}]}
