At the very least, half of the fortress is being continually interrupted by seeing the other half, but there doesn't seem to be any fighting taking place. I'm having a hard time telling who is on which side as there doesn't seem to be any relevant information on the character screen. I tried using the `fix/loyaltycascade` script, but that is just saying \"no loyalty cascade found.\" Save is at http://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=14181.
