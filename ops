These arise fairly frequently in DF names, and at least one plugin uses the gender markers ♂ and ♀. The characters in names typically do not render at all, while the gender markers render as a replacement character.\n\nPossibly relatedly, trying to paste a UTF-8 character into the DFHack console when the console code page is set to 65001 causes the dfhack console to close, although without crashing DF itself.","files":null}]}
