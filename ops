On the other hand, the whole patches directory was removed [a while ago](https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/commit/8a9e3d1a) and there seems to be a resolution not to bring them back - besides the fact that there are no binpatches for the 0.40 series.\n\nI'd appreciate clarity on this.  As a proposal:\n- Remaining binpatch-related code will be removed from the repo and future releases\n- The issue mentioned above can be closed\n- Documentation for binpatch can be deleted\n\nThey're just in a zombie limbo state at the moment, and it's time to put them out of their misery.","files":null}]}
