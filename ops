I've experienced this with most versions of DF i've run with or without DFHack. \nMy latest fix for this when running something setup like Masterwork DF (where the mouse scroll wheel zooms in or out, not sure if this is the case in vanilla setups) is simply to zoom in once and then zoom back out with the mouse wheel. Forcing it to re-render like this seems to fix the issue at least temporarily. For me it's gone from a really annoying issue to a minor thing.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"4f2823b111a40d19603a11dc9e0f3c589bea0f03"},"timestamp":1366818247,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTQxNDM3","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/194#issuecomment-16941437"},"message":"I'd say not a bug in DFHack.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"4f2823b111a40d19603a11dc9e0f3c589bea0f03"},"timestamp":1366818247,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDY0NDc0OTQ="},"status":2},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1423176694,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzMTEyOTA2NQ=="},"added":["bug"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"e77d0a5f059ed8eaaa1afef6624480d02a2f025a"},"timestamp":1423176696,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzMTEyOTA5MA=="},"added":["no change required"],"removed":[]}]}
