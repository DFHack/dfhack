It is quite a helpful command at times, but it is currently only found by looking at the code. Something like adding to the examples:\n\nautolabor haulpct \u003cpercentage\u003e\n    Set the percentage of dwarves to be haulers.\n\nUnless of course it isn't meant to be an official command for the plugin.","files":null}]}
