Documentation says the script should activate every day, but it does not activate for me at all. Removing the burrow and doing it for the whole map does not work either.\n\nI tried waiting a month, saving and loading the game, as well as erasing the ~8500 logs l had gathered and waiting.\n\nAutochop does activate once if I go into `d-t-c` and hit Esc. I assume this setting is correct?\n\n![untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13466852/40430717-083261ac-5ea6-11e8-9cf5-dfff96a1c5af.png)","files":null}]}
