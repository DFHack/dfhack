But just in case:  \n- Add a command line option that will load DF straight into the named save game, bypassing (or at least instantly auto-navigating) the main menu\n  - Will open DF and cause _data/save/xyz/_ to be loaded; no main menu is shown; the user first sees the normal game loading screens and once these are completed is at the map.\n- Would be somewhat useful for all users, who most likely use the main menu 95% of the time only to load their current save and might thus appreciate the ability to set up a shortcut that takes them straight into it.\n- Also useful for speeding DFHack testing in situations where a new DF instance is required because load/unload is insufficient\n  - Could also enable some basic automated testing: create a script that launches DF into a given game, execute a defined lists of commands then exit at the end.\n- Other potentially useful options:\n  - Load the most recent save\n  - Load a random save from a given list\n  - Load save 1, run comands XYZ, then load save 2, etc\n  - If necessary all could be achieved from the launcher script rather than the plugin itself\n\n**Example invocation:**\n- Windows:  DwarfFortress.exe -load region1   _or_,  DFLoaderScript.bat -load region1\n- Linux/OSX:  ./dfhack -load region1\n  - If DFHack can't read DF's argc/argv, then perhaps this could be facilitated by a launcher script/batch file (a new one for Windows, existing `dfhack` for *nix)\n    - The launcher script writes the name of the game to load to a text file which is then checked by a plugin; if the file is found and the game name within it is valid, the plugin loads this game on DF launch.  The plugin then deletes the text file.\n    - Or the script uses the API to pass a \"load game\" command to the DFHack plugin - assuming the plugin can load fast enough to accept the command in a timely manner from the same script that launched it\n\n**And the ability to switch saves in a loaded DF:**\n- DFHack plugin the can be executed from console/Lua UI: `loadgame xyz`\n  - When executed, kills the current game (like `die`) but does not exit DF; instead loads a different game into existing DF\n  - Equivalent to quitting back to the main menu (without deleting all saves) and loading a different game.","files":null}]}
