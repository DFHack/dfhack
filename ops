I am trying to run it without a terminal as I use ctrl+shift+p and don't need the terminal.\n\nI am able to start dfhack from the terminal both directly with ./dfhack and with the start file listed below. Both run without issue.\n\nDesktop file:\n`[Desktop Entry]                                                                                                                                                                                \nEncoding=UTF-8                                                                                                                                                                                 \nName=Dwarf Fortress                                                                                                                                                                            \nGenericName=Dwarf Fortress                                                                                                                                                                     \nComment=A single player fortress management game.                                                                                                                                              \nExec=/home/xxx/Documents/dotfiles/.config/desktop/startdf                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nTerminal=false                                                                                                                                                                                 \nType=Application                                                                                                                                                                               \nCategories=Game;`\n\nstartdf file:\n`DFHACK_DISABLE_CONSOLE=1 DFHACK_HEADLESS=1 /home/bloodlines/Downloads/df_linux/dfhack`\n\nI have attempted to add \u0026 to the end but that also has the same issue.\n\nAny ideas on what could be causing this would be helpful.
