And been used for dfhack for some time. However they are not used as often as in other projects and are not as strict. E.g. this feature request is too vague, implementations are too numerous and there is no \"right\" way to do it. Some feature might be required by the \"engine\" (meaning c++ plugins or core or modules) but currently there is no indication of that.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"f7b5a7930d0e1264ae1e4a774b03a7e78c2b7858"},"timestamp":1477575176,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjY0MTU2Nw==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/issues/910#issuecomment-256641567"},"message":"I haven't gone through and removed all of my feature requests, don't worry!
