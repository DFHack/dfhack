For some reason that added blank line gets included the next time that description is fetched, so it probably has somehow been added to the wrong item.\n\nYou may also consider squashing multiple items onto the same line, as I suspect there's a fair bit of info that's pushed below the bottom edge even at the first viewing.","files":null}]}
