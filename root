I've been spawning obsidian with the wonderful range function en mass and creating buildings. It is slow to add height, but workable once you make it so a dwarf can climb to a given z level in the sky (The game does not \"read\" sky squares unless a dwarf could conceivably access them for pathfinding/FPS purposes). Working on a very massive fort currently and some interesting things happen:\n\n1.) When creating multiple z level high obsidian blocks to tunnel out for building.... If two z levels have obsidian spawned right on top of each other, the area type will remain \"outside light\" until you dig out the top z level area Thus you have to spawn, dig, spawn dig. Still worth it though :).\n\n2.) Because of number one above and the walls tiles being stacked one right on top of the other, the wall's information will always read \"outside light.\" This has no appreciable game effect other than shadowing\n\n3.) it is very easy to be off a tad when casting en mass with range function on DF liquids. Use with caution. :)","files":null}]}
