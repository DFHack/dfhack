When multiple build directories are being used in the same DFHack clone, a build step in one writing to files in the source tree (outside of the current build folder) can cause the build process in all other build folders to re-run jobs that depend on those files unnecessarily. I'm not entirely sure if anything does depend on the generated HTML files (there shouldn't be anything, ideally, aside from the installation process), and the HTML files should be consistent regardless of the build directory, but it would be good practice nonetheless.\n\n(I ran into a similar issue with protobuf's testHashMap.cpp being placed in the source tree, which meant that switching build directories and running `make` would re-run `cmake` every time, since testHashMap.cpp had been changed from the other build folder.)","files":null}]}
