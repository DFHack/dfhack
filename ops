For example, there could be a `bind` command, so that `bind alt-r reveal` would bind Alt-R to the reveal command.  Since there'd be more room to set things up than just the hotkey name, the commands could be given parameters, like `bind alt-r reveal all`.\n\nThis should probably only work from the fortress's main menu, since which keys the game does or doesn't use varies too much to do it regardless of the game state, and since the main menu has many keys which it isn't using. It seems that `*(gui-\u003edf_menu_state) == 0 \u0026\u0026 gui-\u003edf_interface-\u003eview.child-\u003echild == NULL` can be used to test for this condition.","files":null}]}
