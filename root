The first is adding support for inorganics with spaces (aka a lot of the gems). This could be resolved by delimiting inorganics with commas instead of spaces in the command. The second suggestion is being able to set a priority for digFlood's designations. Currently, digFlood sets no designation at all, and my units seem to always take priority over digFlood than other digging designations, even over priority 1. You could possibly add a -priority tag. My third suggestion is a more targeted version of digAll that you can set for all ores or all gems, such as digAllGems[0/1] and digAllOres[0/1]. I am loving digFlood otherwise!","files":null}]}
